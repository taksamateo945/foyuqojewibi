It wasn’t just Director Charlie and Spencer Downing (the latter pictured above) on NCIS for Itzin; he played multiple characters on the same series a few times before.&nbsp;In the aforementioned “Star Trek” franchise, Itzin played several different roles in “Voyager,” “Deep Space Nine,” and “Enterprise.” He would do the same in shows like “The Practice” and “Night Court.”</p><p dir=ltr>Itzin is perhaps best known for his work in the television show “24.” In it, he played Vice President turned President Charles Logan. He was revealed to be the show’s big bad in an epic reveal during his run on the show that lasted from 2005 through 2010. He was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for both outstanding supporting actor in a television series and outstanding guest actor in a television series for his work in “24.” The actor also had a steady career in movies as well. One of his last film roles was in Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln” in which he played historical figure Judge John A. Campbell.</p><p dir=ltr>Early “NCIS” fans would surely not forget Itzin’s contributions to the series as he was one of the cast members of the show when it first got running. Plus, with his ties to “JAG,” the actor put his stamp on the early lifeblood of the ongoing franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHmqtmm5iWv6Kv056prGWUnrFus9GenqiqqWK2tcbIp2SppJGufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
