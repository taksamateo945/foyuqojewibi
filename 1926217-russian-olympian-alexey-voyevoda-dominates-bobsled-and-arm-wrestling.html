Alexey Voyevoda (sometimes written Alexei Voyevoda) is one of those Olympians.
NBC Olympics' Nick Zaccardi offers a wonderful profile of a hulking figure some Americans might not be familiar with. We are referring to Sochi native Voyevoda—a man who competes as a bobsledder and a professional arm wrestler all while maintaining his vegetarian lifestyle."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We are referring to Sochi&nbsp;native&nbsp;<span>Voyevoda—a man who competes as a bobsledder and a professional arm wrestler all while maintaining his vegetarian lifestyle.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Voyevoda holds the distinction of winning a silver medal in the 2006 Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy (four-man bobsled). He most recently helped secure a bronze for his country in the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada (two-man bobsled).&nbsp;</p><p>All that's left is the elusive gold that would cap off an already prolific athletic career. Besides playing a big part on the bobsled team,&nbsp;Voyevoda can also do some damage in the arm wrestling circuit.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to locking hands and showing off his might in arm wrestling, the man who weighs a reported&nbsp;115 kilograms (about 254 pounds) is a three-time world champion.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is an example of what he can do:&nbsp;</p><p>And here is a video you can watch, which does have the option of English captions:&nbsp;</p><p>Arm wrestling is far from a passing interest. Voyevoda explains:&nbsp;</p><p>Arm wrestling is a&nbsp;very serious thing. Many more countries practice arm wrestling than bobsleigh. I plan to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;arm wrestling after the&nbsp;Sochi Games. I have many options.</p><p>Arm wrestling has helped me a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;my bobsledding career. My role on&nbsp;the team is to&nbsp;stop the&nbsp;bobsleigh. I do this with the&nbsp;strength I have acquired through arm wrestling.</p><p>At this point, we wouldn't be surprised if he just carried the bobsled down the hill.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are wondering how someone becomes so strong, perhaps you should look to conquer <span>some nearby trees. The bobsledder offered to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tétrault-Farber</a>, "I grew up in&nbsp;the mountains and&nbsp;I would always climb trees with the&nbsp;other children. I was the&nbsp;fastest of&nbsp;the little tree-climbing monkeys. That is how I became strong."<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Voyevoda goes on to say that the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi hold a special place in his heart, not just because he would love to see a renewed sense of urgency from Russian citizens to delve into athletics, but because he grew up in the host city.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the most intriguing aspect of the athlete who also featured in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2009's documentary Pulling John</a> is that he has been a staunch vegetarian for two years.&nbsp;Not only that, but he proclaims to fuel up on solely water for breakfast.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So you can pretty much forget any preconceived notions you might have about the body frame of a vegetarian.&nbsp;</p><p><span>When it comes to the&nbsp;Sochi Games,&nbsp;Voyevoda&nbsp;has more than just winning gold medals on his mind.</span></p><p><span>"My role as one of&nbsp;the ambassadors of&nbsp;the Games is to&nbsp;promote sport, to&nbsp;encourage people to&nbsp;adopt a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle."<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tétrault-Farber</a>&nbsp;writes, only a quarter of Russians regularly enjoy any amount of "physical activity."&nbsp;<span>Voyevoda is hoping a couple of weeks in the spotlight for Sochi will turn into a wealth of change when it comes to the health of his countrymen.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>The world is about to enjoy what we hope will be a wonderfully successful Olympics in&nbsp;Voyevoda's backyard. We just wouldn't suggest challenging him to arm wrestling or any amount of tree climbing.&nbsp;</p><p>Hit me up on Twitter:&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaHJqZmd%2BeHnRrqqsoZGjerC42KanopmeYq6tsdeesGaun66yt7vDmmSdp52eu6LAxKxkm6eSqLmmsIyapZ1lkae6bsPRnqqtpJmjtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
