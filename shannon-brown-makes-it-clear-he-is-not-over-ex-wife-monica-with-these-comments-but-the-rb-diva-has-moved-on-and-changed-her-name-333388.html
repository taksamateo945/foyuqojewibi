He wrote: ‚ÄúThat stare does something to me !!!!!‚Äù</p><p>He posted another picture with Monica and added: ‚ÄúWhen people don‚Äôt know to mind their own business‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3TApGiBWQ-/</p><p>This made the message loud and clear for most of his fans, and it looks like everyone is currently in a pretty good understanding of the way things between Shannon and Monica are.</p><p>And even though some of their supporters have been asking them to reconsider their situation and give their relationship another shot, it does not look like this is going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Qh4J4BM7-/</p><p>Despite their long-running marriage and the children they share, the two have decided to move on with their lives, and nothing can stop them at this point.</p><p>The best their fans can do is offer them some support in what is undoubtedly a challenging period behind the scenes.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3A6QWLhAeM/</p><p>Even though the two have been acting strongly in public, it is clear that they are both going through quite a lot right now.</p><p>One person had this reaction: ‚ÄúI know Monica somewhere laughing, but I hope they can make it work.
