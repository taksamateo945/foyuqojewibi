Scalabrine Gets Blocked by a Rookie Derrick Rose</strong></p><p>Many think that Scalabrine's first experiences with the Chicago Bulls came after he signed here in the summer of 2010. However, die-hard basketball fans know that he was a big part of the seven game, seven-overtime first round series between Chicago and Boston during the 2009 NBA Playoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>Scalabrine was forced to fill in for the injured Kevin Garnett at times during that series, and he did not disappoint. He did not disappoint Bulls fans that is. On one particularly notable play, Scal received the ball on a fastbreak and was wide open under the basket, and subsequently went up for a dunk. Well Derrick Rose had other thoughts...</p><p>In other news, the worst part of Scalabrine being a Bull was the no headband rule...</p><p>Watch Scal get stuffed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>4. Scalabrine Goes Off Against the Nets</strong></p><p>On January 23 of this year, Brian Scalabrine had a true highlight package in a game against New Jersey. He had three highlight reel assists, and showed off the hang time while swerving around Kris Humphries at the rim.&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch video highlights of that game&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Scalabrine Goes Off in Italy</strong></p><p>The lockout was a tough time for NBA fans, as fans were prevented from seeing games because millionaires were fighting with billionaires. However not all of it was bad, as marginal NBA players like Brian Scalabrine had the opportunity to showcase their skills in other leagues.&nbsp;</p><p>Scalabrine signed a contract with Italian team Benetton Treviso during the lockout. During his tenure, a highlight video came out of a game against Avellino. In that game, Scalabrine scored 18 points in 34 minutes, and reminded fans that he can shoot the ball with the best of them.&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch Scal make it rain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Scalabrine Gets MVP Chants on the Road</strong></p><p>On February 28, 2011, Scalabrine showed once and for all what a cult figure he had become in his half a season in Chicago. In a game against the Washington Wizards in Washington, Scalabrine came into the game for a grand total of one minute, and scored on an impressive bank shot. After that, Scal received the Derrick Rose treatment and received MVP chants. To be fair, he scored 72 points per 36 minutes, right?&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to Scalabrine getting MVP chants <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Scalabrine Trash Talks the Media</strong></p><p>In 2008, the Boston Celtics won their first NBA Championship in 22 years, and their 17th overall NBA Championship. Part of that team was the "White Mamba," who logged a total of zero minutes and zero seconds in the NBA Finals. Afterwards, Scal got on the podium and trash talked everyone who doubted them. Well played Mr. Scalabrine.&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch Scal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>We'll miss you White Mamba.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGxqZWd%2FennBq6Capl2osKK4wJupoqaVYr%2BmwMirnKxlpJ2ybsPHoqueZZ2WuqOt0marqKhdanquu8yepa2rXZ67bq7OrKuopl2Wu6V5wqGgnJmXpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
