Ramaphosa announced at the country's latest family meeting on 30 October and declared the day before the 16th a holiday, an announcement which <a href=#>South Africans</a> did not appreciate.</p><h2>Ramaphosa declares holiday date</h2><p class=align-left>Ramaphosa's announcement came after <a href=#>he promised the nation</a> that should the <a href=#>Springboks</a> win the World Cup, he would consider 29 October a public holiday. Since then, there have been calls for him to stick to his word. According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eyewitness News</a></i>, the country's first citizen announced that the holiday would be a day of hope, celebration, and unity. He also shared why he declared the holiday on 15 December and not in October or November.</p><h2>Ramaphosa's reason for 15 December holiday</h2><p class=align-left>Ramaphosa stated that he wanted to give the matrics a chance to write their exams. This is because the <a href=#>matric examinations are currently underway</a>, and he considered that having a holiday this month or next month would disturb the students' ability to focus on the examinations.</p><h2>Netizens refuse to accept the holiday</h2><p class=align-left>South Africans commenting on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> rejected his holiday and roasted the president of Mzansi.</p><p class=align-left>Vincent Hlatshwayo said:</p>“This one is good in giving holidays while we are already on holiday.”<p class=align-left>Mantini Walanga remarked:</p>“We are going to ask each other what it is for because we would have long forgotten that we have a World Cup on our shelves.”<p class=align-left>Davey Wa Moruto wrote:</p>“This doesn’t change that we unseat him and the ANC next year.”<p class=align-left>Kerlvinator Carlvino asked:</p>“So what exactly are we going to gain instead of dealing with the high petrol and food prices?”<p class=align-left>Dikgang Legoase mused:</p>“These are the results of parachuting a CODESA billionaire into the president's office.”<p class=align-left>Jojo Mashamaite exclaimed:</p>“I’m so angry at him. Now I have to go to work in this cold weather.”<h2>80% of North West issues solved: Ramaphosa</h2><p class=align-left>In similar news, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that <a href=#>Cyril Ramaphosa</a> announced that 80% of the <a href=#>North West's service delivery issues were solved</a>.</p><p class=align-left>To prove his point, the president visited Ikageng after residents expressed concern that the service delivery was not improving. South Africans did not believe him and criticised him for trying to stay relevant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLG7y6KropujZH54fpRpa2arkWK%2FprbEnKusZZOuv6q4jKuYppmgnby0rdJmaG5llJqwprnBnqlmoJ%2BhtqWt2GaanqSVl7%2BiwMRmqqmqmaO0o7vKrGSwoZ6jtq%2BzjKusoJqpYsSwvsudZJytoGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
