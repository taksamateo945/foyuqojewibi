Plz know, I’m so grateful for FOTB renewal. I love the cast & crew. I’m proud to be a part of it.”</p><p>She added: “For all the fans support, thank u & for all who support my casual use of the word f**k – thank u too 😘”</p><p>In her original Twitter rant, the 37-year-old actress said this in response to news of Fresh Off The Boat‘s renewal: “So upset right now that I’m literally crying. Ugh. F**k. F**king hell.”</p><p>When a fan congratulated her on the show’s renewal, by writing, “congrats on your renewal! Great news :), she said, “No it’s not.”</p><p>Constance later returned to Twitter to say the following: “That was not a rampage; it was just how I normally talk. I say f**k a lot. I love the word. Y’all are making a lot of assumptions about what I was saying. And no, it’s not what it’s about. No it’s not..what this is all about. Stop assuming.”</p><p>Fans are still bashing Constance for her behavior.</p><p>One of them said: “I think she was on the heels of getting reprimanded, fired, or sued (or maybe all three), so she backtracked those comments right on back LoL 😂😂”</p><p>A second commenter claimed: “Ok she literally said it wasn’t good news and wrote “dislike” under the post 🙄. She probably was hoping it got canceled. Then backtracked. I don’t know why celebs get on social media and air their feelings. Then get annoyed when people question it.”</p><p>This supporter wrote: “Then why did she type “dislike” in the comments of the renewal announcement???? Explain that one sis….🤔Damn one good movie role & she’s too good for the show🤨. She needs to relax before she ends up like Katherine Heigl.”</p><p>A fourth fan said: “Apparently the original creator got pushed out and none of the cast like the direction that show is going in but that’s just some speculation I’ve heard. I’m going to pretend I didn’t see that because I love Constance and fresh off the boat.”</p><p>Another critic shared: “So sis got mad that her show got renewed because maybe she’s ready to do other things but can’t get out her contract. It got back to the , and her publicist told her to retract her statement and make the public think they’re crazy for assuming something that she clearly said. Got it.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Regardless of what she meant, Constance has to clean up this controversy.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTpLu0wMCnmp5lp6p6orzOpaagoaqawG6tzZ1koqtdqMGquMtmnp6spJ67qHnDq5ign5WZerDCxKtkn6qVqLVuu8WfZK2glWKvsK3TZqmeppWsrq15w6KqrGVibX50fZZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
