After being treated for her wounds, she was arrested and charged with two counts of felony murder. As reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>Journal & Courier</a>, Brandi initially pleaded not guilty and planned to claim she was legally insane. However, she eventually changed her plea to not guilty and was subsequently sentenced to 120 years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Harry Siamas said, “Sometimes there’s no explanation. Darkness is in this world. And it penetrates minds and our hearts.” Brandi remains incarcerated at the Indiana Women’s Prison in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p><p dir=ltr>In the midst of his devastating loss and his quest to obtain financial assistance for his ongoing expenses, Jason contacted YouTuber Philip DeFranco via Reddit. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Netline</a>, Jason told Philip his children loved listening to his show.
