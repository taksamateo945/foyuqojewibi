Today, the 32-year-old posted a photo of her in a bikini, holding a bottle to her lips. How does the star stay so fit given that she's so busy? Partly thanks to workouts at the Dogpound training center and with Thrive With Julia. Read on to see which exercises Vanessa Hudgens does there to stay in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bikini Photos!&nbsp;</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/vanessa-hudgens-cali-water-1.jpg><p><span>One of the key ways Vanessa stays in sensational shape is by working out daily. "I would do seven days if I had time," she told Parade about her workouts. She tries to get her workouts in as soon after waking up as possible. "I love starting my day off that way because sometimes I'll have a less productive days and if I've gotten a workout in, then I feel like I'm accomplished no matter what."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/vanessa-hudgens-unicef.jpg><p><span>Vanessa started off her mini workout video, which was </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>first shared by her trainer in May</span></a><span>, by perfectly executing sumo squats with a kettlebell. The compound exercise is incredibly effective, forcing a variety of muscles — including glutes, quadriceps, calves — to workout together. Clearly she was having some fun with her fitness routine, as she playfully stuck out her tongue for the camera.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/vanessa-hudgens-italy-copy-2.jpg><p><span>In another compound exercise, Hudgens held a medicine ball while she executed a slide squat, a move made extra hard with the addition of a resistance band around her ankles.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/vanessa-hudgens-italy-3-copy.jpg><p><span>Next up, a reverse lunge to high knee with dumbbells. Another compound move, this exercise works everything to the legs and butt to abs. For the workout video, see here:</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/vanessa-hudgens-main-1.jpg><p><span>In addition to weight and strength training, Vanessa stays in shape with lots of other workouts. Pilates, Soul Cycle, hot yoga, and strength training are a few of her favorite workouts—and sometimes she even does multiple workouts a day. "Some days when I have the time, I love doing Pilates first and then going over to Soul Cycle. I love a double up!" she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Parade</span></a><span>. "I always feel so accomplished when I double up. I've been going to this Pilates studio called WundaBar for years and it's just a great deep muscle-training workout. It's not super high intensity but I always feel it the next day."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkr5memsC0rYyhrJ2flaPAbq%2FApaBmr5GpsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
