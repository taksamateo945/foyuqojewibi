"<strong>Charlie Mae Annable</strong>. Born September 7th. I took Labor Day quite literally this year. Dave gave me this blanket on Mother's Day and baby Charlie and I slept with it our entire hospital stay. Charlie is a lucky lady to have you as a papa, we love you so much @dave_annable. Thank you all for the love that you've shown us through this journey."</p><p>The Annables <a href=#>fittingly announced</a> that they were expecting their first child together on Mother's Day. The couple <a href=#>discovered at a gender reveal party</a> the following month that they were having a little girl.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I was pulling boy all the way and then I heard 'girl' and I don't think I've ever felt more love in my heart. In that moment I was just, 'Oh my God!' It was just great," Dave, 35, <a href=#>told <strong>Us Weekly</strong> last month</a> in an exclusive interview. "To have all of our family and friends and to be able to do it like that where you find out all together and on Odi's birthday – it was pretty special. You can't duplicate that ever again. It was pretty amazing for us."</p><p>The Brothers and Sisters alum, 35, told <strong>Us</strong> that he had lots of fun activities in store for his daughter — namely, sports. "My sweet little girl has got no choice," he joked. "I think definitely golf is a part of our family and Odi and I love to play, so I think we will bring our little girl out there and teach her. I grew up playing with my father and grandfather."</p><p>In early August, the pregnant actress celebrated the upcoming arrival of baby Charlie with a glamorous baby shower, shared exclusively with <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKadnaSpsm6tzaeYm6SVYrSqwsSsZJuhoqm1bsPEpZqopZWoeqOtwbJknZmlnLW1sdFmrqKsmGKxosLEZqehp6SkenN8kG5oaXE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
