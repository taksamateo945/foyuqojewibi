"Nothing was decided until today, but as of tonight a decision has been reached. [Husband] SimonvanKempen & I are leaving #RHONY, sadly but amicably."</p><p>"Alex and I are sad that it's come to this," Simon Van Kempen told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "We had a great four years. We don't intend for this to be the final time you'll see us on television. Everything happens for a reason. We are not happy, we're not sad. It is what it is. We thank our fans. We have tremendous, tremendous outpouring of support…We're not going away. We remain happy and long may that continue."</p><p>A rep for Zarin, 47, told THR: ""Jill is out of town with her husband Bobby and they are visiting her daughter Ally at college for family weekend so she is not speaking with the press. I can tell you that she is very happy and extremely busy with the national launch of her shapewear line Skweez Couture by Jill Zarin which will debut at Lord and Taylor stores across the country this month and then roll out at other national retailers in the coming months. Jill is humbled by the extraordinary amount of media interest in her response and looks forward to personally opening up about all of this very soon and announcing some exciting new projects.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>No word yet from Bensimon or Barshop.</p><p>"I have 100 percent faith in every girl that is on the show," returning housewife <strong>Sonja Morgan </strong>told <strong>Us</strong> on Thursday.
