With his career still at its peak, Israel is bound to earn more income from his future fights, thereby increasing his net worth and sponsorship deals even further.</p><p>The 34-year-old mixed martial artist not only makes his income from winning his fights but also from the number of PPVs he sells and how well he is able to entertain his viewers. Generally, his income is from various sources which include his base salary, pay-per-view earnings, and sponsorship incomes.</p><h2><strong>How Much Did Israel Adesanya Earn as a Kickboxer?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are no current details of Adesanya’s earnings as a kickboxer.

He also went on to win six more amateur fights fighting almost exclusively with Wu Lin Feng in China.
