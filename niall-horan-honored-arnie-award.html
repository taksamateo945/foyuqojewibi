He collaborated with his management to launch a boutique agency named Modest! Golf Management to materialize his dream of encouraging and supporting young talent to join golf. As reported by Golf Digest, while talking about boutique agency, Horan said,</p><p class=body-text__p>“I wanted to get into supporting the next generation of golfers, and obviously I feel myself and my management company, who have a long history of looking after clients and all their needs from schedule planning to corporate deals, are very well placed to do this,” he says.We brought in Mark McDonnell and Ian Watts, who between them have 30 years’ experience in the golf industry, to assist us.”</p><p class=body-text__p>The singer believes in giving back and he is doing his best to fulfill his promise.</p><p class=body-text__p>What do you think about Niall’s endeavor?
