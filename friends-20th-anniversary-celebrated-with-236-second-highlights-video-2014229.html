Called “The One With 236 Seconds,” the video offers a retrospective on the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Each member of the group of New York City pals gets his or her time in the spotlight in the clip, which includes many of the best moments from Friends, which ran for 10 seasons and earned multiple Emmy awards, including a win for Outstanding Comedy Series.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=475 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt=friends style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> opens the visuals as Rachel Green in her wedding dress from the show’s pilot, later marrying Ross Geller in Las Vegas and experiencing personal triumphs such as finishing a crossword puzzle. <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong>, who tweeted on Monday, “Friends premiered 20 years ago today. How time does fly,” is shown as her character Monica Geller, acting out her famous “seven” scene and dancing with a turkey on her head. Ross (<strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong>) is seen rocking out on his keyboards, reinforcing his break from Rachel, and getting way too artificially tan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Matthew Perry</a></strong> has a segment as Chandler Bing, repeatedly asking if things could “BE” any worse, and working at his mysterious job. Joey Tribbiani (<strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong>), complete with “How you doin?” phrases, faces off with his buddy, trying on everything in Chandler’s wardrobe and saying, “Look at me, I’m Chandler! Could I BE wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn’t going commando!” The group is topped off by Phoebe Buffay (<strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong>), singing “Smelly Cat” and attempting to seduce Chandler. Even Janice (<strong>Maggie Wheeler</strong>) makes an appearance to utter “Oh. My. God.”</p><p>Get nostalgic and take a look at The One With 236 Seconds in the video above! <a href=#>See amazing pics of the Friends cast — then and now</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOn6minZ6ZwG5%2Bj62fZpmeo7a3sdGsmKuxXZiyrbHBq5itnZRixKrAx2ZpbG5dqLKku82dZKGhl525qrPHrapmrpmZsrB5kWlobWpibg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
