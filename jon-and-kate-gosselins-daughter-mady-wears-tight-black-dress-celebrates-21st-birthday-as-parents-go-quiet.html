Jon and Kate Plus 8 star celebrated her milestone birthday during an intimate dinner party with friends.</p><p>The college sophomore posted a TikTok video of the festivities where she wore a Happy Birthday headpiece and a black cocktail dress and stockings.</p><p>She scanned the camera around the table where her friends gathered for a candlelit dinner and drank wine out of red solo cups.</p><p>The dining room was decorated with black streamers, Halloween decorations, and gold number balloons displaying 21 as the centerpiece.</p><p>Everyone smiled at the camera as Mady set the phone down to attempt a few full-length shots of her outfit.</p><p>She concluded the video with a closeup of herself posing for a pic as the song That Funny Feeling by Phoebe Bridges played in the background.</p><p>Just days prior, the star showed off a similar look donning a <a href=#>mini black dress</a> while dancing to a song in the video.</p><p>The ex reality star paired the dress with a black sweater for the short clip, which she captioned: “i cannot get this song out of my head”</p><h2><strong>‘UNCONVENTIONAL CHILDHOOD’</strong></h2><p>The <a href=#>Kate Plus 8</a> alum is no stranger to TikTok, jokingly&nbsp;shading her family life back in July.</p><p>The former TLC star poked fun at her past as she shared a video of her wrapped up in a blanket in bed.</p><p>With her eyes closed,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>college student</a>&nbsp;wrote across the video, “How I sleep knowing that I can’t relate to this lyric because I had an extremely unconventional childhood AND I have ADHD.”</p><p>The star made the comment in reference to a line from Olivia Rodrigo’s song, Enough for You, that played in the background in which the singer sings, “And maybe I’m just not as interesting as the girls you had before.”</p><p><a href=#>Mady</a>&nbsp;then turned the hilarity on herself as she admitted that she may appear a “little TOO interesting” to others in the caption.</p><p>Mady’s parents&nbsp;<a href=#>Kate</a>, 46, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Jon</a>, 44,&nbsp;have had an ongoing custody battle since their divorce in 2009 after 20 years together.</p><h2><strong>FAMILY DIVIDED</strong></h2><p>After years of back and forth court fights, the co-parents currently split which of their kids live with which parents.</p><p>A source told&nbsp;<a href=#>HollywoodLife</a>: “Kate picked up and moved the kids down to North Carolina to spend their junior and senior years there with a totally new life.”</p><p>Four of the exes’ 16-year-old sextuplets – Aaden, Joel, Alexis, and Leah – live with Kate and have&nbsp;<a href=#>moved with her to North Carolina</a>.</p><p>The other two, Collin and Hannah, live with their dad and will remain with him in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Mady and her twin sister Cara, are both currently living on campus at their respective colleges.</p><p>On if Mady and Cara will eventually join Kate, the insider added: “The two older girls are in no rush to go to North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>“They weren’t happy about the move because they have no friends there.”</p><p>The sisters would normally return home to stay with Kate, not Jon, when they were on holiday and summer breaks.</p><p>Now, they’ll have to go to her new home in North Carolina, instead of closer-to-their-colleges in Pennsylvania.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
