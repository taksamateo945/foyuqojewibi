In the first chapter, Caroline granted Sergio’s request for marriage — though she wasn’t that into it. Then, Sergio proposed the idea of starting a family, but the bride-to-be was ambivalent.
While the 27-year-old is determined to procreate, the 46-year-old already has three children.

Their clashing interests are yet to be resolved on <a href=#>the first season</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Real Housewives of Dubai</a></strong>.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel=noopener>preview</a> for the July 6 episode, Sergio reveals the stress he and Caroline are feeling as they prepare for their upcoming nuptials. “We are a bit stressed, to be honest, with the wedding,” he said at a group dinner. “Family is coming.”</p><p>Both Sergio and Caroline’s parents are coming at the same time, though they’ve “never met before.” He added, “They’re gonna stay together three days in the house… It’s just a lot of things happening.”</p><p>His fiancée then shared, “We’re literally going to kill each other before the wedding.”</p><p>Caroline joked that “Sergio will be sleeping in [another castmate’s] house, with his mother, can you take his mother too?”</p><p>The clip also addressed the tense relationship between Caroline and <strong><a href=#>Chanel Ayan</a></strong>.</p><p>Chanel, it seems, had given every cast member a gift — except Caroline, who refused to sit silent.</p><p>“I got nothing,” said Caroline after interrupting Chanel at the dinner. “I got absolutely nothing. I mean if that wasn’t subliminal messages, I don’t know what was.”</p><p>Chanel didn’t back down. “It was subliminal messages, definitely,” she said. In a confessional interview, Chanel threw more shade: “Nothing… That was the best gift I could have given her.”</p><p>In a previous episode, the two castmates hugged it out at a party as a gesture of reconciliation. At the time, many fans believed the women had reached an understanding. The recent clip, however, tells a different story, as their lingering emotions rise to the surface.</p><p>The hatchet is officially unburied.</p><p><a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Dubai</strong> </a>airs Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iuerW0yKeerGWnmr%2BmedGomqSxXay2tbSMnJirp5yeu6Z50p6poKGfZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
