When we first got married, it was so much fun to eat like him. We got into this habit we called the bedtime snack. The drawers next to the bed were filled with candy. Eventually, I realized it was mindless eating.”</p><p>Added the actress, “I was just doing it because he was doing it, and it was adding hundreds of calories I didn’t even think about. So I cut that out. Our refrigerator and pantry have completely changed, because we don’t eat crap anymore. No more soda, chips, cereal; we had boxes of stuff that only a 4-year-old would eat.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKapJWueqTBzpymZqeeYrWmvoyhpq1lkqSxunnFqKlmq5iWvaZ5wqitnqpdlrmtechmmK2dXayutHnApaSoppSoenN8kG5ocXE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
