Before delving into solutions, let’s explore the causes of your (entirely normal) swelling.</p><p>Swelling typically arises from <strong><a href=#>inflammation</a></strong> or <strong><a href=#>fluid accumulation</a></strong>, especially during the second phase of the wound healing process post-surgery, known as the inflammatory stage.</p><p>During this stage, the immune system releases white blood cells to envelop the wounded area, causing fluid buildup. This process facilitates healing by providing a pathway for repair cells to reach the wound, and it aids in eliminating pathogens, bacteria, and damaged cells during the healing process.</p><p>Surprisingly, acute inflammation, manifesting as swelling, is a beneficial response of the immune system to heal injuries or combat infections.</p><p>This stage may involve redness and heat around the incision post-surgery, though it is usually somewhat painful, serving as an indispensable aspect of the healing process.</p><p>While inflammation is a natural mechanism for the body to self-heal, excessive inflammation can be detrimental, causing more tissue damage and impeding wound healing. Thus, the objective is to regulate it and expedite your body’s recovery.</p><p>The recovery duration for cosmetic surgery hinges on the procedure, treated area, and your body’s healing prowess. Resuming regular activities may take anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks, with specific limitations based on the surgery type. For example, a breast lift surgery might permit a return to work after just a week, with exercise restricted for up to 6 weeks.</p><p>Regardless of the procedure, swelling typically peaks in the initial days post-surgery.</p><p>Encouragingly, <strong><a href=#>nearly 80% of swelling subsides weeks after plastic surgery</a></strong>. The residual amount may persist for months to a year before complete disappearance, marking full recovery and complete healing of the surgical wound.</p><p>Acknowledging this, the desire to mitigate swelling quickly is reasonable. Whether undergoing rhinoplasty, facelift, liposuction, or another cosmetic procedure, here are ten leading supplements to consider for reducing swelling after plastic surgery.</p><p><strong>Here are the Supplements To Reduce Swelling After Rhinoplasty:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="query-text ng-star-inserted" dir=ltr>1. Vitamin C</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:254><strong>Vitamin C</strong> is often touted as a helpful supplement for reducing swelling after rhinoplasty.
