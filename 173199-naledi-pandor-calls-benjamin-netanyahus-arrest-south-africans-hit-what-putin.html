In response, Israel declared war against the <a href=#>military</a> group and attacked hospitals, public facilities and buildings, killing thousands in Gaza.</p><p class=align-left>Pandor remarked that the country should not allow the war in the Middle East to continue. She added that the <a href=#>people</a> of Palestine are denied the right to exist as human beings and the freedoms and rights South Africans fought hard for. She pointed out that all humans enjoy the right to freedom. She said parliament cannot stand up for abuse.</p><h2>Mzansi reminds Pandor of Putin</h2><p class=align-left>South Africans on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> turned on her and recommended that she take a similar stance against Vladimir Putin, who <a href=#>declared war on Ukraine</a> last year.</p><p class=align-left>Walter Kohlhöfer said:</p>“You ask for him to be arrested. What about Putin?”<p class=align-left>Mafana Machava pointed out:</p>“Same as what Russia is doing to Ukraine.”<p class=align-left>Richards Nantchengwa pointed out:</p>“This is madness of the highest level. Someone can’t call out Russia, but they call out Israel, yet Russia and Hamas/Palestine did the same.”<p class=align-left>Muhamad Adam pointed out:</p>“Israel became a problem because no one stood up properly when they committed an atrocity in 1948 when they arrived. Russia is doing that now to Ukraine, and that’s maybe why the work is fighting for Ukraine.”<h2>Allan Boesak condemns Israel</h2><p class=align-left>In a similar article, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that apartheid struggle veteran <a href=#>Allan Boesak condemned Israel</a> as an apartheid state.</p><p class=align-left>Boesak, who was joined by hundreds of pro-Palestinian marchers in <a href=#>Cape Town</a>, protested against the role of Israel in their war with Hamas.
