Finally, three years after <a href=#><strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong></a> revealed that she had a secret, two-year relationship with Big Bang Theory costar <strong>Johnny Galecki</strong>, the 38-year-old is opening up about the romance. And yes, the two are still close.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re dear friends, still. Kaley’s not just an ex, she’s a part of my life,” Galecki tells the December issue of <a href=#>CBS Watch! magazine</a>. So, why has he never mentioned their past before? “I just don’t like to speak about it. And not because I’m trying to be enigmatic; I just worry that it will conflict with people’s acceptance of Leonard and Penny,” he says of the pair’s TV characters on the Big Bang Theory. “I get the curiosity, but I don’t want to distract from the story.”</p><p>Galecki and Cuoco have starred in the CBS comedy together since 2007. Three years into the series, Cuoco <a href=#>opened up about their relationship for the first time</a> with CBS Watch! magazine in September 2010. “We dated for almost two years. It was such a huge part of my life and no one knew about it,” Cuoco revealed. “This is the first time I’ve ever talked about it, ever. It was a wonderful relationship, but we never spoke a word about it and never went anywhere together.”&nbsp;</p><p>“[We were] so protective of ourselves and the show, and we didn’t want anything to ruin that,” she continued. Unfortunately, Cuoco admitted keeping so tight-lipped eventually took a toll on their relationship.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“We knew we weren’t destined to be together. We accepted it and said, ‘Look, if we ever break up, we will be professional,'” she recalled. “I’m so lucky it was a mutual ending and that we don’t hate each other. We’ve seen that happen on other shows.”</p><p>Since the shocking reveal, both actors have stepped out publicly with new romances. <strong>Us Weekly </strong>exclusively broke news about <a href=#>Cuoco’s engagement to tennis player <strong>Ryan Sweeting</strong></a> after three months of dating in September this year. Days earlier, the couple attended — <a href=#>and sat right next to</a> — Galecki and his girlfriend <strong>Kelli Garner</strong> at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Galecki and the former Pan Am star first debuted as a couple in March 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGooJ6jxm6zwKWcnKOZYryxsc2sZK6oXZavsMHTZqqem6KawW7A1qhksp2Rp3qzu8yapZydXay2tbSMpJilnalisLa7wqhksJ2imnqlscCrZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BMa2dqa2dmfg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
