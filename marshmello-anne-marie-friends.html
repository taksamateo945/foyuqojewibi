Since then, he has enjoyed&nbsp;a string of huge releases with tracks such as ‘Wolves’ with Selena Gomez, ‘Silence’ with Khalid, and ‘Chasing Colors’ with Noah Cyrus racking up huge streaming numbers on Spotify.</p><p>Whilst Anne-Marie has made a name for herself as one of the UK’s most exciting rising stars with her solo material, she is no stranger to collaborations either. Anne-Marie was the lead vocalist on Clean Bandit’s monster hit ‘Rockabye’ in 2016, which spent nine weeks at the top of the singles charts, claiming the Christmas number one in the process. She has also collaborated with the likes of Snakehips, Nick Jonas and Mike Posner.</p><p>‘FRIENDS’ is available <a href=#>now</a>.</p><h4>Are you loving Marshmello and Anne-Marie’s new offering?
