(FHI).</p><p>However, <strong>Silvio</strong>‘s lawyer contended that <strong>Julia</strong>‘s claims of 50 percent ownership had already been rejected by one court.</p><p>The 45-page filing claims <strong>Silvio </strong>“begged” <strong>Julia</strong>, who was his fiancée at the time, to serve as EWG’s CEO in June 2019. He also allegedly convinced her that EWG should pay a management fee of 2 percent of their annual revenue to the parent company.</p><p>“<strong>Haart </strong>reasonably relied on <strong>Scaglia</strong>‘s representations. Not only had they worked together for a number of years, but the two also were engaged to be married at the time,” the suit reads. “<strong>Haart </strong>agreed to this arrangement in part out of love for her fiancé, who she knew needed cash on a day-to-day basis, but also based on <strong>Scaglia</strong>‘s representation that the shares he was transferring would make her a full 50 percent owner of FHI.</p><p>“<strong>Haart </strong>would not have agreed to this arrangement had she known that <strong>Scaglia </strong>would later take the position that he had total control over the money in FHI’s account. <strong>Haart </strong>has since learned that <strong>Scaglia</strong>‘s representations to her concerning her ownership and control of FHI were all a pack of lies and that he never intended for <strong>Haart </strong>to be his equal partner or to share equal ownership and control of FHI,” the filing continues.</p><p><strong>Julia </strong>also alleges that <strong>Silvio </strong>made changes to FHI’s articles of incorporation in order to issue himself preferred shares of company stock before transferring 50 percent to her. She claims this made her control “purely illusory” and gave her “no ability to prevent <strong>Scaglia </strong>from taking all of the money paid by EWG for <strong>Haart</strong>‘s valuable services as CEO for himself.”</p><p>“<strong>Haart</strong>‘s indentured servitude must be remedied,” the complaint states. “It cannot be that a man can convince his wife to give up millions in dollars in salary and benefits, plus an employment contract at the peak of her career (along with the security and independence that come with those things) and then leave her with nothing when his bait-and-switch is revealed.”</p><p><strong>Silvio</strong>‘s attorney <strong>Lanny J. Davis</strong> of Davis Goldberg & Galper PLLC refuted the claims in a statement to People. “She has refiled claims that have already been ruled on by a Delaware judge who rejected them — [who ruled] that she doesn’t own 50 percent of Mr. Scalia, or Freedom or any of the company’s assets,” he said.</p><p><strong>Julia </strong>filed for divorce from <strong>Silvio </strong>in February 2022 after nearly three years of marriage. She subsequently alleged she was wrongfully fired from her role at EWG as part of a “personal vendetta” he had against her.</p><p>The lawsuit also accused <strong>Silvio </strong>of “egregious, bullying, unauthorized conduct” by cutting off her corporate cards, prohibiting her access to the EWG office, shutting off phone service at their home and terminating her assistants. <strong>Julia </strong>also claimed that he had used the press to plant false reports about her.</p><p>In addition, she claimed that he had “become increasingly volatile, abusive, and unhinged” toward her and her children in recent weeks.</p><p><strong>Julia </strong>shares four children – <strong>Batsheva Haart</strong>, <strong>Miriam Haart</strong>, <strong>Shlomo Haart</strong> and<strong> Aron Hendler</strong> – with ex-husband <strong>Yosef Hendler</strong>.</p><p>In March, it was reported that she was wanted by police for allegedly stealing a car.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6topaliwq%2B70a2fqJyfrXqttcWeZKyskad6q8HLophmoJGWv7V50q6crGWVqMGzrc2gnJ1lmKrAo63NnWSsoZyrtrB50pyYoKSZlnqnu9FmaW5vXaK2rbjIqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
