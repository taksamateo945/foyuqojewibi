PEOPLE Magazine confirmed that Brad made sure to send the perfect gift.</p><p>He was also spotted at a surprising art expo currently taking place at the lobby of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel that is focused on Jennifer created by Kristen Morgin titled “Jennifer Aniston’s Used Book Sale.”</p><p>A source told spoke Hollywood Life and explained that the actor is in a great place in his life and feels like he can have a stable relationship with his former spouse.</p><p>The source close to the actor explained: “Brad [Pitt] felt good seeing Jennifer [Aniston] again and spending time with her at her birthday party. Brad has done a lot of work on himself since being in a relationship with her, so he feels like a different guy. He also still has a lot of love for Jen, his [first] ex-wife. He hopes attending her birthday party may be the start of a new beginning in their journey together. He is trying to keep an open mind about everything.”</p><p>The insider went on to say: “Brad is in a great place and wants to share his life with people he cares about and to become friends with Jen again would be a big win for him. It’s really cool that he can mend fences, and as he gets older, he wants to be in a place where everything is good, and being friends with Jen again and having that friendship again is very important to him.”</p><p>The source added: “He wants to continue to go towards that path. Her friends were happy to see Brad at the party. Whatever caused their divorce is long in the past. He was invited, so why shouldn’t he go? He’s single and has no one to answer to. He and Jen spent many important and happy years together. He obviously decided to join her celebration because he wanted to.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Another person revealed to the media outlet that like the rest of the planet, Angelina was shocked by the pictures showing the father of her children gleefully going to Jennifer’s event.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRm8GmvoybqZqcXaW2tcCMrJynrF2pvK%2Bz1J5ksJmXnLavs4ywoK2gXZ%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGjtrTAzqeqZpqZp8GpsMCyZKmZoqnGbrrOsGShnV2ewG6%2FxKeboqaXYrWmvoylpq%2BdXai2qLrApWSappeauaq6wGahqKSZmnqqv4ysq6KknGKzprHLoqWgZaSdsm6%2Fx6iapGViaYN5hZho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
