This week, Melania with a very light blonde hair color sat down for a penetrating interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel where she spoke about falling in love with the businessman back in 1998.
She said: “We had a great chemistry when we met in 1998 and we started dating, and we dated for a long time before we got married, and we got married, we had a son, but we had a great chemistry from the day one."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I took a lot of steps; it’s not just like you end up here.”</p><p></p><p>The mother of one also took the opportunity to slam her critics by saying: “You learn a lot on the way here and in my business, in fashion business, it’s a tough business as well and here the politics as well, it’s a tough business, and you need to have very thick skin.”</p><p>A source told Hollywood Life that the holidays bring out the flirty and loving side of Melania.</p><p>The insider claimed: “Melania is always in a way better frame of mind when it’s the Holidays, and she automatically feels more loving and warm towards Donald, as she does the rest of her family too at this time of the year. Melania is a huge fan of the Holidays, especially Christmas, and ever since she was a little girl it has always been an important and big deal for her, and that’s only intensified since becoming First Lady.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BrWNl0NAytC/</p><p>The pal added: “It’s not just becoming filled with the Christmas spirit that’s spurring Melania on to being more affectionate towards Donald these past few weeks—they’ve always had this ‘us against the world’ mentality, and whenever Melania feels Donald is most under fire and attack is when she rallies and really comes through for him. Contrary to what many people seem to think, Melania and Donald’s marriage is actually genuinely built on love, and when the chips are down, and Donald’s back is against the wall, Melania is at her most loyal and fierce.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Melania is ready for the new year.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrmiusiaZK2qpaK9bq%2FHmqWgnaNitaa%2BjKGYoqpdmb%2Biv9OimpqknK56qrqMp5ywZaaesaa7jJqkopxdp7Kvsdaem2abmJq6qr%2FTq7Bmr5mptW7Ax55knaeelrmleZFra3BxZWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
