According to In Touch Weekly, family matriarch Michelle explained in a 2013 interview that the women dress modestly from neck to knee to make sure there is no “defrauding.” She explained that she teaches her kids that defrauding is the stirring up of desires that can’t righteously be fulfilled.</p><p>In other words, Michelle doesn’t want her daughters wearing revealing clothing, so they don’t tempt men.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joseph Duggar: Slammed For Turning Wife Kendra Into "Baby&nbsp;Machine" <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/D9mAUDKHdj</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/AiHzZoWfop</a></p><p>— Styleupnow (@StyleUpNow2017) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 20, 2019</a></p><p>Kendra Caldwell- who recently turned 20 – and her husband, Joseph, are <a href=#>expecting their second child</a> who is due this fall.
