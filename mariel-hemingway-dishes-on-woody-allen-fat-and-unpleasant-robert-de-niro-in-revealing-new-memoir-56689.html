The couple — who have an age difference of 35 years — later married in 1997 and now have two adopted daughters, <strong>Bechet Dumaine</strong>, 16, and <strong>Manzie Tio</strong>, 15.</p><p><a href=#>RELATED: Mariel Hemingway Dishes on Woody Allen, “Fat and Unpleasant” Robert De Niro in Revealing New Memoir</a></p><p>“I lucked out in my last relationship. I’ve been married now for 20 years, and it’s been good. I think that was probably the odd factor that I’m so much older than the girl I married. I’m 35 years older, and somehow, through no fault of mine or hers, the dynamic worked,” Woody said of their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/woody-soon-yi-family.jpg><p>Woody and Soon-Yi with their two daughters in June 2002.</p><p>“I was paternal. She responded to someone paternal. I liked her youth and energy. She deferred to me, and I was happy to give her an enormous amount of decision-making just as a gift and let her take charge of so many things. She flourished. It was just a good-luck thing,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8yaqaKdnGK1prnIp56wmalisaq%2Fx56qZqeeYsSwu8OyZJqknJq7brLArWSappRiwq%2B8y56YrJmeqXqzu8Geqa1llJp6r7XRqGSipl2nsrexwKWgp59do7K4ecyepKihomKCd4KXcg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
