In The Hollywood Reporter's Pride issue, which features an oral history of &#34;How I Came Out in Hollywood,&#34; Bass described how he was &#34;scared s---less&#34; about people learning his secret the height of *NSYNC's popularity.
&#34;The bigger we got, the more people are looking into your personal lives,&#34; he told the outlet. &#34;I always knew I was gay. Five years old, I knew I was gay, but I also knew that it was something I'd have to hide the rest of my life because my Southern Baptist upbringing told me that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He said yes, not knowing the guy was a reporter.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">When his phone started ringing off the hook, Bass said he knew he had to say something, so he arranged to tell his story to People magazine. "It all happened within 48 hours of coming back from that vacation," he recalled. "Talk about a Band-Aid being ripped off very publicly."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">Other stars who told their stories to THR include Clay Aiken, Jim Parsons, Rosie O'Donnell and Neil Patrick Harris.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmfK2cqcKzsY6lmKeblWKvor%2FSZqmem5GhubR5zaywp5ujYr%2BmrcKtoKimXZi8rrXNoGasrJ%2BnxoC1w3ZuamhobYB2gQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
