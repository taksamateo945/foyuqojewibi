This is the second time in just over a week that they’ve teamed up, with the previous single being “Amapiano” which has already racked up an impressive 20 million global streams.</p><p>Olamide Adedeji is a singer-songwriter, African icon, and music executive, from Nigeria. He has been in the music industry for many years, first dropping his debut single, titled “Eni Duro”, back in 2010, following it up with his debut album in 2011, titled “Rapsodi”, and has since released more than half a dozen full projects since. His latest album, 2021’s “UY Scuti” went on to amass over 220 million streams alone, across platforms. In 2012, he started his own record label, YBNL Nation, and he has gone from strength to strength, earning millions upon millions of music streams worldwide, with his track “Infinity” featuring Omah Lay being his most-streamed track on Spotify with 98.1 million streams on the platform. His YBNL Nation record label has quickly become one of the most respected record labels in Nigeria since he founded it, going on to launch the careers of Asake, Fireboy DML, and Adekunle Gold, amongst many others. Olamide is certainly a force to be reckoned with, he exudes talent and is someone who is bound to go globally viral anytime soon.</p><p>As for Asake, who is also known as Mr. Money whose real name is Ahmed Ololade, he is an emerging Nigerian singer-songwriter making waves in the music industry. Hailing from Lagos Island and raised by Yoruba parents, Asake’s journey into music was an unexpected one. Initially a dancer, he ventured into the world of music after showcasing his energetic performances on stage during his time at Obafemi Awolowo University. His Afro-Fusion style and magnetic stage presence quickly garnered attention, and in 2020, his freestyle track “Lady” went viral, earning recognition from notable Nigerian influencers. Asake’s music reflects his name, which means “Specially Chosen”, and his songs often revolve around his lifestyle and personal experiences. His breakout single “Mr. Money” further solidified his confidence and authenticity. In 2020, Asake received nominations at the City People Music Awards and won two categories, including the Most Popular Song of the Year. He collaborated with industry heavyweights like Broda Shaggi and DJ Xclusive, and his remix of “Mr. Money” featured Afrobeats powerhouses, Peruzzi and Zlatan. Recently, Asake signed with YBNL Nation and Empire Distribution, continuing to make his mark in the music scene. He released his debut album “Mr. Money With the Vibe” in 2022, which gained significant acclaim and secured the top spot on the Nigeria Albums chart. With collaborations alongside artists such as Burna Boy, Olamide, Fireboy DML, Russ, and Tiwa Savage, Asake’s versatility and talent shine through. Notably, his collaboration with Fireboy DML on “Bandana” became his most-streamed track on Spotify, accumulating over 61.8 million streams, with “Sungba (Remix)” featuring Burna Boy behind at 36.1 million streams, on the platform. Recently announced as one of the top trending and most-streamed artists by Audiomack, Asake continues to captivate audiences with his compelling musical offerings.</p><p>Written by the artists themselves, while it was produced by Bbanks and Magicsticks, “New Religion” is set to become your new favourite Afrobeats summer track of the year. The accompanying music video reflects the song well and will certainly capture your attention, it has been directed by Jyde Ajala, and has already amassed over 4.6 million views.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Watch the official music video to “New Religion” by Olamide & Asake here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Totally showing why they’re two of the biggest Afrobeats artists in the game, Olamide and Asake lay down strong rap flows induced by an addictive heavy beat that is perfect for summer. Determined to make your party go off, “New Religion” sees both artists flawlessly lay down verses whilst the track itself gives us an unforgettable rhythmic chorus that will stick with you for the rest of the day. Their sweet flows launch into powerful lines that see them describing who they are and that their talent is what got them to where they are today, with Olamide mentioning in the verses about being on tour, about the girls around him, and about the money he makes, whereas Asake’s addicting chorus mentions football players Pele and Maradona, fashion such as Balenciaga, as well as a slight nod to his dancing past stating that he has “moves like jagger”. Their references are brilliant and they manage to weave everything into the lyrics to make an impact, showcasing their brilliant artistry and songwriting ability, and there’s no denying their incredible vocals and rhythmic talent, and those harmonies on the last verse are complete fire.</p><p>As for the music video, we watch Olamide driving a Rolls Royce up to the gates of a mansion where a woman is seen mowing the lawn. He is asked for a passcode and is soon granted access. This is where the song’s backing track fully starts, with Olamide driving through the gates and we see various other half-naked women on the grounds, one of whom is cutting hedges in the shape of the artists’ faces. Asake soon starts to deliver the chorus in the exquisite hallway entrance where women are graciously standing on the staircase or on the landing. He is filled with energy, giving us the stage presence we expect from him, this scene is intercut with him on the lawn wearing double denim supported by a group of men who look like backing dancers and look similar to him and who are all wearing double denim too, yet they are standing completely still. The video goes on, with Olamide performing on the drive in front of his car, as well as in the entrance hall, bringing his own rap energy, and performing with style and vigour. The video later contrasts with a snowy setting where the artists can be seen driving snowmobiles with their love interests. This is a fully-fledged, iconic video that showcases Olamide and Asake brilliantly whilst also intercutting scenes that relate exactly to the track into the visual with stunning scenes of the property and the women enjoying the pool, the bedroom, and the bath, not to mention the fact that they manage to bring some old-school class into the video with the artists playing chess, but with their minds!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stream the newly released song on Spotify here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“New Religion”, by Olamide & Asake, is available to download and stream, right now, across all platforms, via YBNL Nation & EMPIRE. The track acts as the lead single from Olamide’s forthcoming album, titled “Unruly”, and Asake is also set to release his sophomore album, “Work of Art”, later this month.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Let us know what you make of “New Religion” by Olamide & Asake on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kvK2tzKKbnmWRo7FurdKaop5lk6S5ra3BqKmarJVirqityKdkn6eiYsGpsYysnJynnpl6tbXMnmSipl2kw6a%2BjJpksJ2VoHqlvs6pp6Kml2LBqbGMmq6eq5%2Bism6txaumm52RqcBuv9SmpJ6qXZa7tbTEpmSnp12nsq21xqKmp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
