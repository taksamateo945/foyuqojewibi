She grew up with mother Nancy, father Donald, and older siblings Nathan, Abigail, and Susan; her sister Cynthia died of a heart defect at two months old before Heche was born. During Anne’s childhood, her family moved close to a dozen times. Her father was a choir director, and in a 2001 interview with Larry King, Heche stated, “I don’t think he made much on that a week. He said that he was involved in a business of gas and oil. And he said that until the day he died. But he never was involved in the business of gas and oil ever.” When Anne was 12, the family settled in New Jersey, and they lived in a bedroom in the home of a family from their church. Heche worked at a Swainton dinner theater to help her family save up enough money to move out.</p><p>In March 1983, Anne’s father died of AIDS at age 45. Heche has said that her father raped her from her infancy until she was 12 years old and that he gave her genital herpes. Three months after Donald’s death, Anne lost her 18-year-old brother, Nathan, after he reportedly fell asleep while driving and hit a tree. The family then relocated to Chicago, and Heche attended Francis W. Parker School. When she was 16 years old, Anne auditioned for the soap opera “As the World Turns” after an agent saw her in a school play. Though she was offered the job, Heche’s mother wanted her to graduate from high school first. Just before her 1987 graduation, she was offered the roles of Vicky Hudson and Marley Love on “Another World.”</p><h2><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>From 1987 to 1991, Anne appeared in more than 70 episodes of “Another World,” and she won a Daytime Emmy for her performance. In the early ’90s, she guest-starred on “Murphy Brown” (1991) and “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles” (1993) and appeared in the TV movies “O Pioneers!” (1992), “Against the Wall” (1994), and “Girls in Prison” (1994) and the feature films “An Ambush of Ghosts” (1993), “The Adventures of Huck Finn” (1993), “I’ll Do Anything” (1994), “A Simple Twist of Fate” (1994), and “Milk Money” (1994).

Heche had an uncredited role in the Will Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg comedy “The Other Guys” (2010), then she appeared in the films “Rampart” (2011), “That’s What She Said” (2012), “Black November” (2012), “Arthur Newman” (2012), and “Nothing Left to Fear” (2013) and starred as Beth Harper on the sitcom “Save Me” in 2013.

Superintendent Katherine Brennan on NBC’s “Chicago P.D.” from 2018 to 2019.</p><h2><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Though most of Anne’s relationships have been with men (including legendary comedian Steve Martin), she famously dated comedian <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> from 1997 to August 2000. She met cameraman Coleman “Coley” Laffoon while working on a documentary about DeGeneres, and they married on September 1, 2001. Heche and Laffoon welcomed son Homer on March 2, 2002, and they divorced in March 2009. In December 2008, Anne’s representative confirmed that Heche and her “Men in Trees” co-star James Tupper were expecting a child, and their son Atlas was born on March 7, 2009. Anne and James spilt up in 2018.</p><p>In August 2000, Heche drove to Cantua Creek (outside Fresno, California) from Los Angeles, walked 1.5 miles through the desert wearing only shorts and a bra, and knocked on a stranger’s door. Occupant Araceli Campiz, who recognized Anne from “Six Days, Seven Nights,” let her into the home, and Heche drank numerous glasses of water, took a shower, asked for a pair of slippers, and said she wanted to watch a movie. Once Campiz realized that Anne didn’t seem to be planning on leaving any time soon, she called the sheriff’s department. When deputies arrived at the home, Heche told them that she was God and that she was “going to take everyone back to heaven in a spaceship.” The deputies then called an ambulance, and Anne was taken to University Medical Center in Fresno (a 50-mile drive) and admitted to the psychiatric unit. Heche was released after a few hours. Anne has said that for the first 31 years of her life, she was “insane” and that this resulted from being sexually abused by her father during her youth. She revealed that she coped with this by creating a fantasy world, the “Fourth Dimension,” and by adopting an alter ego known as “Celestia” who received messages from God. In a 2001 “Larry King Live” interview, Heche stated, “I had to live through a lot of life to get to the place where I am now. I had to see truths and work through shame, and I’m very grateful for every step that I took.”</p><h2><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 2004, Heche was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for “Gracie’s Choice,” and she earned two Daytime Emmy nominations for “Another World,” winning Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 1991.

Kolzak Award at the GLAAD Media Awards and a Lucy Award at the Women in Film Lucy Awards, and she received a Career Achievement Award at the 2019 Sarasota Film Festival.
