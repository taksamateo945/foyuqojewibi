Sorry, my mistake; "Willow" made his TNA debut in triumphant fashion.</p><p>Hardy returned as the Willow character and joined MVP’s team in the Lethal Lockdown match. He helped MVP and the American Wolves defeat Team Dixie. They wrestled control of&nbsp;TNA operations away from TNA owner Dixie Carter.</p><p>Willow made his Impact debut on March 13, getting disqualified in a match against Rockstar Spud. He whacked Spud with an umbrella while entangling Spud’s legs on the top turnbuckle in the tree of woe.</p><p>Yes, you read that right. Willow hit Spud with an umbrella and got himself disqualified.</p><p>Let’s analyze this scenario. Hardy, as the Willow character, made his debut on free television against Rockstar Spud. A former TNA champion appeared in a match against Rockstar Spud. In my opinion, Spud&nbsp;hasn’t shown enough to belong in that ring. Willow also gave the referee a Twist of Fate and then assaulted Spud some more.</p><p>Willow’s appearance was strange, bizarre and outlandish.&nbsp; He sauntered down the ramp toward the ring in a black coat and demonic mask while twirling a black-and-white umbrella.</p><p>When he took off the coat, it was just Jeff Hardy in a mask flaunting a mean streak.</p><p>Jeff Hardy’s Willow character is being set up to fail.</p><p>Don’t blame Spud; he’s just doing the job conceived by the TNA creative team. If anyone’s to blame, it’s Hardy himself.</p><p>Hardy had a great opportunity to completely reinvent himself by his look, but he failed.</p><p>Compare his reimagining to Mick Foley’s WWE debut in 1996. Foley took a character in Mankind and made it his own. He even went from a psychopathic persona to a lovable underdog. This was the same man who became a hardcore legend as Cactus Jack all over the world.</p><p>Keep in mind that it took time for Foley to win the fans over. It took years of quality promos and matches. Hardy, however, isn’t known for great promos.</p><p>Hardy’s Willow character could suffer the same fate as the persona changes of Samoa Joe and AJ Styles.</p><p>Joe was repackaged as the leader of the “Nation of Violence,” a character that lasted two months before Joe enrolled in the Main Event Mafia.</p><p>Styles also underwent a character change before returning to his old ways, a storyline that ran for only six months.</p><p>Maybe the third attempt is the charm for TNA when it comes to repackaging its wrestlers. Maybe it has found Hardy’s niche and can garner more intrigue from the fans.</p><p>Hardy’s initial transformation reminds me of the Undertaker's biker character, a gimmick which debuted in 2000. The Undertaker made it work by mostly being himself but slowly changing his appearance. His biker persona lasted more than three years.</p><p>Jeff Hardy is no Undertaker or Mick Foley, nor should he be. Hardy needs to carve his own path to make Willow work.</p><p>Frankly, with TNA’s track record, expect the Willow character to have a shelf life of three months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWloYGmEdnnJnp2fZZiWv6XF0mauoqScpMRur8eaqZqbpJq%2FbrXSZpmeoZ6cerSx02asqWWkpHqnrcil</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
