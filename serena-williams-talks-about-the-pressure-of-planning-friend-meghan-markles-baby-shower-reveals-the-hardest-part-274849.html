I’m a perfectionist, so I’m like, ‘Let’s make it perfect.’’</p><p>And that was not all! She admitted that it was ‘a lot’ especially since it happened mid-award season when she was also tasked with presenting the Best Picture nominee at the Academy Awards.</p><p>Either way, as expected, Serena did a great job and she is very proud of it.</p><p>The event took place at the Mark Hotel penthouse and was attended by stars such as Gayle King, Amal Clooney and Jessica Mulroney.</p><p>The tennis star mentioned that she always strives for the best quality in everything, be it her fashion line, investments in female-empowering companies, or, of course, a special party for a great friend.</p><p>And the love and support are mutual! After Prince Harry was seen wearing the ‘boss blazer,’ part of Serena’s collection last year, the item sold like hot cakes!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘It’s so fun because people are like, ‘Oh my God. Like wow, the quality is crazy.’ Listen, if we’re giving our stuff to Meghan, it has to be the highest quality that we can get. So, that’s what I tell our team internally: ‘We have to make sure it’s super high quality that, you know, is fit for a royal princess!’’ Serena noted.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejmr%2BmusBmrqKknJ6urr%2BMrZilo6NirqO71K1kraCVYr2zsdKsrKudXaSzbrzLmqWnoZ6ceqe%2ByJ6lnWWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6GytHnBmpmyZaOdvLix0Wapnq6Vlrm0edOhnGagkaexpr%2FTZqeaqqRif3iAl21waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
