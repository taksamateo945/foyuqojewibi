Luckily, maternity compression socks&nbsp; can help to alleviate these symptoms and help you feel better. The drug-free option is recommended by doctors, including California-based board certified podiatrist, Dr. Ebonie Vincent.</p><p>“While there are circumstances when you shouldn’t wear compression socks, such as underlying heart conditions that need to be considered and discussed with your doctor, generally speaking, pregnant women can greatly benefit from compression socks!” says Dr. Vincent. “Your lower extremities experience added pressure from the baby’s development which comes with a lot of side effects that compression socks can help treat.”</p><p><span class="px-e17 bg-white inline">In This Article</span></p><ul class="table-of-contents-list list-none mt-e25 mb-0 md:mb-e25" readability=23><li class="flex text-link text-left mb-e25" readability=24><p>01</p><p><span class=bookmark-name>Jump to best compression socks for pregnancy<span></span></span></p></li></ul><p>Compression socks have pressure that helps to stimulate blood circulation, which allows the veins to function properly. They also help to reduce swelling. “With increased swelling to the legs, the likelihood of developing a blood clot or a deep vein thrombosis is increased. Wearing compression socks can help reduce your chances of developing these potential life-threatening blood clots,” says Dr. Vincent.</p><p>Compression socks can be worn all day, and especially if you decide to workout, travel or have to stand for an extended period of time. Dr. Vincent recommends applying an over-the-counter preventative athlete’s foot treatment like Lotrimin AF Daily Prevention Powder&nbsp;on your feet before putting on the socks.</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>Compression socks come with varying levels of compression. “Levels of compression come in measurements of millimeters per mercury (mmHG). I recommend 15-20mmHg if you’ve never worn compression socks and are looking for something lightweight, 20-40mmHg for moderate swelling, and 40-50mmHG for severe swelling,” says Dr. Vincent. “I am mostly recommending knee-length compression socks 15-20mmHg.”</p><p>Shop some of our favorite compression socks for pregnancy below.</p><h2 class="text-h2 wg-inline-shopable__title mb-[20px]">Best compression socks for pregnancy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kohls-socks.png><p>Cutest prints: Dr. Motion Dotted Compression Knee-High Socks — $5.00</p><p>These cute knee-high compression socks come in a ton of fun prints like cats, koalas, unicorns, llamas, tie dye, French bulldogs, coffee and doughnuts, polka dots, and many more.
