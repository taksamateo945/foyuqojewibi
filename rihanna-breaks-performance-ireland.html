Many videos have surfaced from the concert but one particular video shows RiRi singing the first few lyrics of her famous duet with Eminem “Love the Way You Lie” with tears in her eyes.</p><p>As the crowd of fans belt the song back to the stunning star, she seems to get overwhelmed with emotion, stepping back with her hand in the air. She attempts to continue but repeatedly gets choked up. The reason for why Ri got emotional is unclear at this point but it seems that it could have simply been out of overwhelming love that was coming from the Irish crowd. As fans cheered their support, the 28-year-old composed herself and continued with the incredible show.</p><p>After turning up 30 minutes late to the show which is part of her Anti World Tour, fans expressed their worries on Twitter with numerous tweets taking over the website from confused members of Rihanna’s ‘Navy’.</p><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/grrndne/status/745647342821466112</a></p><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/illestbaba/status/745356014518673408</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#WeLoveYouRihanna</a> it is ok to cry out of happiness <a href=#>@rihanna</a> We know you are a STAR to remember & will continue to support you ????</p><p>— Dave91A (@David91Diaz) <a href=#>June 21, 2016</a></p><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/Iastvegas/status/745353467363987456</a></p><p>After the emotional moment, Rihanna thanked the screaming crowd for their fantastic support by saying, “I only have ever in my life heard an audience of people scream so loud that they sound like one voice and that only happens in Ireland, in Dublin. Thank you so much.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although the cause for this teary reaction is unknown, we hope it was due to the feeling of love she must have been feeling. And regardless of the reason, it was undoubtedly a very sweet moment shared between the Irish ‘Navy’ and the Barbados-born star herself.</p><p></p><p>What do you think?
