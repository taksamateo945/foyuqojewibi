However, the recent separation has made him realize the importance of being honest about their situation and prioritizing self-care. He acknowledged that separations are not always the ideal solution and that he is actively working on managing his anger and improving his ability to communicate effectively.</p><p>Thompson concluded by stating that their decision to separate was not triggered by a single event but rather a culmination of multiple small issues.
