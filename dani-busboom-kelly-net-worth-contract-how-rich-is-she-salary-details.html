She is presently the coach of the Louisville Cardinals, a collegiate volleyball team. Dani has been involved in sports since she was a youngster. She was a multi-star athlete at Adams Freeman High School, participating in volleyball, basketball, and hurdles. She chose volleyball to improve her profession, or should we say volleyball picked her? Dani wowed Nebraska Cornhuskers head coach John Cook at a camp when she was 14 years old.

Dani Busboom earns a respectable wage as one of the greatest instructors in the industry. Her financial wealth, however, is a closely guarded secret.
