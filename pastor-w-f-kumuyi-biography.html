F. Kumuyi?</strong></h2><p>Pastor W. F. Kumuyi is <span>82 years old. He</span> was born on June 6, 1941, in Erin-Ijesha, Osun State, Nigeria. He hails from the same state and is of Yoruba descent. His parents are Mr. Gabriel Kumuyi Akinfenwa and Mrs. Comfort Idowu Kumuyi Akinfenwa and he has two siblings.</p><p>Kumuyi grew up in a Christian family and was raised in the Anglican faith. However, during his teenage years, he embarked on a spiritual quest and started attending various Christian denominations, searching for a personal encounter with God.</p><h2><strong>Pastor Kumuyi Is an Alumnus of the University of Ibadan</strong></h2><p>Pastor William Folorunso Kumuyi is globally recognized as a highly educated individual. Known for his deep knowledge of the Bible and theological expertise, Pastor Kumuyi has demonstrated intellectual acumen throughout his life. He completed his secondary education at Mayflower School in Ikenne, Nigeria. This institution is renowned for its high academic standards and emphasis on discipline.</p><p>Then after completing his secondary education, Pastor Kumuyi enrolled at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria’s premier university. He pursued a degree in Mathematics at this prestigious institution. Upon completing his undergraduate studies, he continued his education at the University of Lagos. He obtained a master’s degree in Mathematics from this renowned university, further cementing his expertise in the subject. He <span class=ILfuVd lang=en><span class=hgKElc>received an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Abuja.</span></span></p><p>While his educational background primarily focuses on mathematics, Pastor Kumuyi’s knowledge extends well beyond this field. After his spiritual transformation and calling, he developed a deep passion for biblical studies and theology, becoming a highly respected pastor and teacher. Through his teachings, he has influenced countless individuals worldwide.</p><h2><b>Kumuyi Started His Spiritual Journey in 1964</b></h2><p>It was during his university years that he dedicated his life to Christ and became a born-again Christian in 1964. He joined the Scripture Union (SU) and became actively involved in evangelical activities on campus. After completing his undergraduate studies in 1962, Kumuyi began working as a Mathematics teacher at Mayflower School in Ikenne, Ogun State, Nigeria.</p><p>From there, he became a lecturer of Mathematics at the University of Lagos. During this time, he encountered some literature from the Higher Life movement, which emphasized holiness, sanctification, and a deeper relationship with God. These teachings deeply impacted Kumuyi and shaped his spiritual beliefs.</p><h3><strong>In 1973, He Laid the Foundation for the Deeper Life Bible Church</strong></h3><p>In 1973, Kumuyi felt a strong calling to establish a ministry that would focus on holiness, the study of the Bible, and evangelism. He started a Bible study group in his living room in Lagos, Nigeria, with only 15 people in attendance.</p><p>Kumuyi was expelled from the Apostolic Faith Church in 1975 for preaching the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. However, he continued until 1982, when this small gathering eventually grew into what is now known as the Deeper Life Bible Church.</p><p>The church experienced significant growth under Kumuyi’s leadership, spreading throughout Nigeria and expanding internationally. Pastor Kumuyi’s ministry has placed a significant emphasis on personal holiness, biblical teaching, evangelism, and social impact.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Kumuyi’s Spiritual Father?</strong></h3><p>Many men of God and preachers have spiritual fathers who in one way or another influenced their beliefs. Pastor Kumuyi has three men whom he studied their works keenly and inculcated some of their teachings in his.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>The three first preachers</a> whose writings shaped and influenced Kumuyi’s religious life and ministry are Charles Finney (1792 – 1875), an American Presbyterian preacher who is known in the Christian Pentecostal world as the “Father of Modern Revivalism,” John Wesley (1703-1791), a British religious reformer and founder of the Methodist Church Movement, and Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892), a Baptist preacher and founder of the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London.</p><p>The restitution and sanctification teaching of John Wesley was allegedly copied by Kumuyi from Methodism. He used Finney’s promotion of salvation by grace and the affirmation of works as the basis for his lectures on an austere lifestyle and self-denial. The preaching approach used by Kumuyi is modeled after one used by Spurgeon, dubbed “the Prince of Preachers.”</p><h2><strong>Kumuyi’s Accident</strong></h2><p>Pastor W. F. Kumuyi has been involved in a few accidents and has escaped some. In 2016, during the Deeper Life Leadership Strategy Congress, he revealed to the pastors how he escaped an air crash and suffered an injury from a car accident some time ago. The accident happened between March and October 2015 and he sustained an injury in his left knee. Further details of the accident are unknown. The pastor revealed this to encourage the listeners not to give up on the work of God, no matter what.</p><h2><strong>Pastor Kumuyi’s Wife and Children</strong></h2><p>Abiodun Olowu and Pastor W. F. Kumuyi met in September 1972. She joined his young Christian ministry and started attending his weekly Bible studies. They later tied the knot on 13th September 1980, in Lagos State. Their marriage is blessed with two sons named Jeremiah and John. On 11th April 2009, Abiodun Kumuyi passed away from fractional stroke.</p><p>Just 18 months after the passing of his first spouse, Kumuyi married 65-year-old Folashade Adenike Blaize in London on 13th October 2010. The Deeper Life Bible Church in London was run by Folashade. They courted and got married at a secret wedding in London with few pastors and church members. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>The wedding came as news and shock</a> to his church members as none of them expected it.</p><p>His second son, Jeremiah, lived a wayward life and eventually gave his life to Christ 10 years after his mother’s death. His first son, John, is happily married. He was suspended from the church for a while because of the kind of wedding dress his wife wore.</p><h2><strong>Pastor W. F. Kumuyi Has Been Involved in Some Scandals Inderectly</strong></h2><p>Over the years, the Deeper Life Superintendent has courted some controversies. In 2020, he was slammed for not speaking against the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>sexual abuse of a 12-year-old</a> student in his school. The mother of the abused student spoke up about the abuse suffered by his son in one of the Deeper Life Schools. Don Davis was starved, molested, and sexually abused during his first two months in school. She also spoke when she was threatened by parents from the school.</p><p>This news got some reactions from social media. Some accused the pastor of preaching Christ and good morals and condoning such ill-treatment in his school. While some dragged him, others advised people to be patient and wait for his action.</p><p>The church released a statement saying that they would investigate the matter and the culprits would be punished. In 2021, the case was charged to court and those found guilty suffered for their crimes.</p><p>Besides this and some other minor scandals, Pastor W. F. Kumuyi has not been directly involved in a scandal concerning women and many other related issues. He is one of the Nigerian pastors who is free from scandals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57z5qqraeiYsRusoykrKatqZ56o7XOoKmaqJiufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
