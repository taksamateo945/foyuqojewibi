She claimed she was “blackballed” from working in Hollywood and protested their initial offer of $500,000 in 2017. But many are hoping she was nicely compensated for working with Netflix now.</p><p>“Ok let’s go! @therealmoworldwide back on the map,” wrote <strong>50 Cent </strong>on Instagram after previously&nbsp;vowing to “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">put her back on</a>.”</p><p>Fifty has heavily praised Mo’Nique and her acting career for the past few months. The “Power” co-creator also took credit for her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reconciling</a> her relationship with Daniels, and pledged to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">end her beef</a> with <strong>Tyler Perry</strong> in March. Two months later, the TV mogul made good on his promise and revealed that Mo’Nique would star in his other Starz series, “BMF (Black Mafia Family).”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49wZmpxX6i1pnnSraaonF2dsrN5xqumrqaUYrSwwIytn55lnJbAtXnLmqygoF2ivK%2B10K6cZquYpLCsv4yfpqWjo2Kup8DEq2SsoJVirq%2B6zq6lnJ2jYrumwMWloLFlo6WypLXApWSdoaKasLWxw2aZsmWcmrJusMCnoJ6ko2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
