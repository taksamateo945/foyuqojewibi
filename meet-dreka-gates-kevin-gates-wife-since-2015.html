She was born Shadreka Centuri Haynes on 31st August 1986, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America, and her zodiac sign is Virgo. Dreka was born into a middle-class American family. Hence, she is an American national; however, she is of mixed ethnicity, African-American.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Haynes grew up in a close-knit family where her mother, Sharon Haynes, is said to be a businesswoman, but there is no information about her father. She has a younger brother named David Haynes, with whom she grew up. Although she spent most of her early years in Louisiana, Dreka currently resides in Calabasas, California, with her husband.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She and her husband, Kevin, share the same birth year (1986) but different months and dates. While Dreka was born on 31st August, Kevin was born on 5th February. They both practice the Islamic religion, and as practicing Muslims, the couple went on a Hajj operation to Mecca in September 2016.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka is an elegant and good-looking young woman who is 5 feet and 7 inches tall. She has a slim body build, weighs approximately 59 kg, and her body measurements are 33-27-35 cm (bust-waist-hip). She has dark hair and dark-brown eyes.&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka has throughout her left hand and chest a lot of tattoos.</span></strong></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She is Well-Educated</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Born and raised in Baton Rouge, Dreka Gates received her early and high school education in some local schools in their neighborhood. After that, she proceeded to Louisiana State University, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in fashion merchandising in 2006. Notably, Dreka initially wanted to study Medicine and become a doctor but later changed her mind.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition to her excellent academic performance, Dreka participated in several academic events in her school and inter-school competitions. Due to her popularity in school, she had the opportunity to meet many people of different classes, and it was only a short time before her path crossed with Kevin.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When and How Did Dreka Gates and Kevin Gates Meet?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates and her husband, Kevin Gates, are high school sweethearts and have been together for 21 years. They met in high school, and according to records, they started dating in 2002. In fact, the duo grew together, although Kevin eventually grew to become more famous than Dreka, thanks to his music career.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They dated for 13 years and decided to establish their love with marriage. They tied the knot on 17th October 2015, and today, they have weathered many storms to stay married. Overall, they have been together for more than two decades. Information about the kind of wedding ceremony they had is not disclosed.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka has been very supportive of Kevin and his career over the years. She has severally stated that her husband is her best friend and that she has never tried to change him. Significantly, the rapper dedicated his single&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;to his wife. However, their relationship and marriage have not been without troubles. They admit that it is not all a bed of roses but that it only works because of each party’s intentional efforts.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Couple Share Two Children</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates’ union with Kevin Gates produced two adorable children. They had both of them before tying the knot, and they were delivered at home. The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Islah Koren Gates, on 30th November 2012 and a son named Khaza Kamil on 10th May 2014.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Islah and Khaza are currently 11 and 9 years old, respectively, as of 2023. Dreka once revealed that she did not vaccinate her children but believed in the power of breast milk to provide sufficient immunity for them.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/sss.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In an interview she granted The Source, the mom of two stated that her kids have not had any of the problems she hears about other kids having. Dreka Gates and her husband intentionally keep their children away from the limelight. So, there is no available information about them.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Are Kevin Gates and Dreka Still Married?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As much as the public knows, Kevin Gates and Dreka are still married. The celebrity couple has continued to keep it going strong despite several challenges they have faced. It was rumored sometime in 2022 that they broke up and got separated.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This came after Kevin dropped a controversial song titled&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Super General</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, which seemed to confirm the rumor. But after that, it appeared the rumors died down, and neither Dreka nor Kevin ever came out to address it. So, it is safe to believe they are still together as husband and wife.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Does Dreka Gates Do For a Living?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although she might not be as famous as her husband, Dreka Gates is a businesswoman in her own right. After her education, she reportedly tried many odd jobs before she became known as she is today. Now, she thrives in different careers, such as modeling, social media influencing, and entrepreneurship.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She has worked on some TV projects and mobile apps, including the TV series Kevin Gates Helpline. Dreka has worked as a model and ambassador for various notable companies and brands. With more than 3 million followers on Instagram, she is an Instagram celebrity, and on the platform, she mostly shares lifestyle pictures and her modeling shots.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She also uses her Instagram page to endorse and promote CBD products for beauty and wellness. She has a self-titled page on YouTube that has gathered over 200k subscribers. She created the channel in December 2017 and has consistently shared content such as travel vlogs, farming videos, skincare tips, and fashion trends.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka is also present on TikTok. Her TikTok account has only a few videos, although she has a considerable following.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What’s more, Dreka Gates is an entrepreneur and a successful businesswoman. She has an online clothing and skincare line, energy drink, dog kennel, and rental houses/flipping properties.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Her apparel store deals in various ladies’ outfits, and the proceeds she gets from there are channeled to The Kevin and Dreka Foundation, whose primary objective is to empower and educate youth. Dreka is a passionate philanthropist who dedicates much of her time to charity.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, although Dreka did not know anything about the music industry as of the time she met Kevin, she intentionally went out of her way to learn all she could about music and started helping her husband gain more visibility. She started working as her husband’s manager, visiting promoters to book shows in a bid to get him some performance slots on stage.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alongside her husband, Kevin Gates, Dreka founded Bread Winners’ Association, a record label that has, over time, extended into a lifestyle brand. She also owns Dreka Wellness and BE Provisions. More than that, Dreka Gates has been featured in a couple of her husband’s music videos, such as</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Power, Islah,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Isla</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, which is his debut album, peaked in the second spot on the US Billboard 200 chart.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates has remained a popular face in the media ever since she met and married Kevin Gates and is doing well for herself. However, there is still no denying that she primarily got shot into the limelight due to the rapper’s already established status and fame in the music industry.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates’ Net Worth</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million. Although there is no public information about how much she makes from each of her endeavors, it is believed that she accrued this figure from her businesses and social media endeavors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, there is no denying the fact that she also lives off he wealth of her husband, whose net worth is pegged at a whopping $20 million as of 2023.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates and Personal Trainer’s Affair Rumours</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In mid-2022, rumors started swirling that Dreka had cheated on her husband with her personal trainer. However, it would later turn out that her personal trainer was not a man. On the heels of the news, photos of Dreka and her supposed fitness teacher circulated all over the internet, and it was a woman.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Yet, this did not put an end to the rumors. In fact, the rumor was further fueled following the release of Kevin’s 2022 song,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Super General</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. A line from the song talks about a personal trainer invading his place. Moreover, the rapper did not hold back on the same track where he expressed sexual desires for Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, and Ruby Rose.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The song, in fact, gave rise to different sorts of infidelity rumors between Dreka and the trainer in question. However, all of that seems to be unfounded allegations. Neither Dreka nor Kevin commented on this particular track to date.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Dreka and Her Husband Survived Controversies, Infidelity, and Prison Stint</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As we have mentioned earlier, Dreka has firmly stood by her husband over the years despite the numerous controversies the rapper has faced, including crime and infidelity. The early years of their relationship were fraught with different dramas, especially concerning Kevins’ encounter with the law and other women.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When he was only 13, Kevin went to jail after he was arrested for being a passenger in a stolen vehicle. At the start of his music career, he got himself into an altercation outside a movie theatre where he stabbed his opponent multiple times. This also landed him a brief prison term.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/ff.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Again, Kevin returned to prison in 2017 after he was sentenced to a 30-month prison term for gun charges. He was released on parole on 10th January 2018. Apart from his prison stints, Kevin Gates has multiple times cheated on his wife, and from those affairs, he had two children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, there are unconfirmed rumors that he once had a sexual affair with his cousin. Yet, in all of these, his wife never changed her mind but stood firmly by him. No wonder Kevin would seize every chance he gets to praise Dreak and lavish her with gifts.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The rapper never stops talking about his wife and her enormous support to his career and life in general. The couple, together with their children, live peacefully and happily in their home in Calabasas.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>FAQs</span></strong></h2><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who is Dreka Gates?</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dreka Gates is the wife of Kevin Gates, the famous American rapper.
