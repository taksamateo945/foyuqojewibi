After the devastating news of Kobe Bryant’s death, Ari took to social media to make some comments that did not go over well with fans of the basketball player or his talent agency.</p><p>Shortly after the NBA legend’s passing was announced, Ari posted a video where he said: ‘Kobe Bryant died 23 years too late today. He got away with rape because all the Hollywood liberals who attack comedy enjoy rooting for the Lakers more than they dislike rape. Big ups to the hero who forgot to gas up his chopper. I hate the Lakers. What a great day! #F***thelakers.’</p><p>He then tried to save face by alleging that he was hacked.</p><p>The day after, he copped to making the joke that was in terrible taste but insists that it was something that he did when any celebrity passes away. He tried to soften the blow by explaining that he made the comments before he found out that Kobe’s daughter and seven other people were on the helicopter.</p><p>In a lengthy Instagram post, Shaffir wrote, in part: ‘Every time a beloved celebrity dies I post some horrible s*** about them. I’ve been doing it for years now. I like destroying gods. And right when a famous person dies they’re at their most worshipped. So as a response to all the outpouring of sympathy on social media, I post something vile. It’s just a joke. I don’t really hate any of the people.’</p><p>His talent agency, Aqua Talent Agency, has dropped him as a client.</p><p>In addition to receiving hate on social media, fans have been calling in bomb threats at comedy clubs where he is scheduled to perform.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think this is something that will blow over?</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRp7Zuv8eanZ%2BhomKxs7vPqZydZZKuerWty56lrWWRnLKvr9hmmJ%2Bslad6q7vKoqWgZaSdrrV5yqiZnmWSp8aiutNmm6KdlGJ%2FdHnYnpirq12pvLB5y5qrnmVja4F3hZBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
