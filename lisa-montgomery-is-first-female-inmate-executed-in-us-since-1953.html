Lawyers for the ‘womb raider’ killer Lisa Montgomery – the first female federal death row inmate to be executed in nearly 70 years – have said she was ‘disconnected from reality’ and that guards refused to allow her spiritual adviser into the death chamber as she was put to death. 
Montgomery, 52, was put to death by lethal injection in the early hours of Wednesday morning after an 11th-hour order from the Supreme Court cleared the way for her execution despite arguments from her lawyers that she was not mentally competent and didn’t understand what was about to happen to her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

federal government since 1953.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In that year the government executed two women, Ethel Rosenberg for espionage on June 19, and&nbsp;Bonnie Heady for murder on December 18.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">ETHEL ROSENBERG:&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1952, Ethel Rosen, 37, and her husband Julius, 35, were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair were accused of providing the Communists with intelligence on radar, sonar, jet propulsion engines, and nuclear weapons.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Julius had worked for the Army Signal Corps but was fired in 1945 when they discovered his membership of the Communist Party USA.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he continued to help the Soviets and recruited Ethel’s brother David Greenglass, who&nbsp;was working on the top-secret Manhattan Project.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutors admitted that their case against Ethel was ‘not too strong’, but believed it was ‘very important that she be convicted too, and given a stiff sentence.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair were convicted at the height of the Cold War and executed together by electrocution at&nbsp;Sing Sing Correctional Facility on the Hudson River on June 19, 1953.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">BONNIE HEADY:&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In September, 1953, Bonnie Heady, 41, and Carl Hall, 34, kidnapped a multimillionaire auto dealer’s six-year-old son in Kansas City, Missouri.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bobby Greenlease, son of&nbsp;Robert Greenlease Sr., was at&nbsp;Notre Dame de Sion that day, a Catholic school for small children.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Heady told the nuns she was Bobby’s aunt and urgently needed to take him home because his mother had fallen ill.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sister Morand recalled how Bobby went with Heady without hesitation and the woman put her arm around the child’s shoulder and took hold of his hand.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Heady and Hall, both drug-addicted alcoholics, then drove the child across state lines to Johnson County, Kansas.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hall shot the boy dead with a revolver.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They then took the child’s corpse to Heady’s house in&nbsp;St. Joseph where they buried him in the backyard.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Afterwards they sent messages to Bobby’s father demanding&nbsp;$600,000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Greenlease asked law enforcement not to interfere and paid out – the largest ransom ever paid in history at the time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The killers collected the ransom money and fled to St Louis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hall later tried to flee with the cash, leaving $2,000 for Heady after she fell asleep drunk at the apartment they had rented.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A cab driver later tipped off the police to the whereabouts of Hall – who had travelled out to St Louis County in an attempt to bury the money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hall later led police to the apartment where Heady was staying in the city.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On November 19, a jury at the federal court in Kansas City recommended the death penalty after a little over an hour of deliberations.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Judge Albert L. Reeves remarked: ‘I think the verdict fits the evidence. It is the most coldblooded, brutal murder I have ever tried.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair were executed together in Missouri’s lethal gas chamber at the State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, on December 18, 1953.</p><p>&lt;!—-><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Montgomery’s gruesome crime unfolded when she introduced herself to her victim via an online chat room for rat terrier owners called Ratter Chatter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She gave Stinnett, a 23-year-old dog breeder, a false name and pretended that she too was pregnant – the pair exchanged emails about their pregnancies.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Montgomery then&nbsp;drove about 170 miles from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She arrived at Stinnett’s Missouri home on December 16 2004, under the guise that she was going to purchase a rat terrier puppy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Montgomery strangled the eight-months pregnant mother with a rope and then used a knife to cut her baby out of her womb before making off with the infant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The victim’s mother, Becky Harper, discovered her daughter lying in a pool of blood with her womb slashed open.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sobbing, she told the 911 dispatcher: ‘It’s like she exploded or something.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The killer was arrested at her home in Kansas the next day after showing off the premature infant, Victoria Jo, who survived and turned 16 last month.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The girl has not spoken about the tragedy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Montgomery was sitting in her living room holding the baby and watching the news when police entered her home – an amber alert for her arrest was flashing on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘As we walked across the threshold our Amber Alert was scrolling across the TV at that very moment,’ recalled Randy Strong, who was part of the northwest Missouri major case squad at the time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He looked to his right and saw Montgomery holding the newborn and was awash in relief when she handed her over to law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutors said her motive was that Montgomery’s ex-husband knew she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile and planned to reveal she was lying about being pregnant in an effort to get custody of two of their four children.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Needing a baby before a fast-approaching court date, Montgomery turned her focus on Stinnett, whom she had met at dog shows.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Montgomery’s lawyers, though, have argued that sexual abuse during Montgomery’s childhood led to mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2007, a jury convicted Montgomery and recommended the death penalty, which was upheld by the judge.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Just before midnight on Tuesday, the Supreme Court issued an order removing the final legal barriers to the execution, and minutes later it became clear it was proceeding immediately as witnesses were moved to the execution area.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Department of Justice issued a new notice of execution, dated January 13, informing Montgomery that her death sentence would be carried out on January 13.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kelley Henry, Montgomery’s lawyer, in scathing remarks, called the execution a ‘vicious, unlawful, and unnecessary exercise of authoritarian power’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Everyone who participated in the execution of Lisa Montgomery should feel shame,’&nbsp;Henry said in a statement. ‘The
