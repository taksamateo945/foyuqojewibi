He said young men need role models who must be father figures.</p><p class=align-left>The host and <a href=#>executive producer of Mzansi Cribs Makeover</a> said every boy has that one man they grew up looking up to and idolising.</p><p class=align-left>He said:</p>"It is important for every man to be the reason and benchmark for every boy to become a better human being for society."Men must understand the difference between funding their kids versus spending quality time with them. Kids need attention, patience, love and time instead of money and material things being thrown in their faces.“My brother, make the effort to have a relationship with your kids because not only do they need it, but you need it too. Family is the backbone of any society.”<p class=align-left>The Amatyma founder urged that every man has a story to tell, and we can't judge. Still, the truth of the matter is that every child needs a father figure, and men who don't take care of their responsibilities for their kids are just perpetuating generational curses.</p><h2>Prince Kaybee sends message of support to SA men</h2><p class=align-left>In a related <strong>Briefly News</strong> story, house DJ Prince Kaybee <a href=#>sent a message of support</a> to his followers on <a href=#>Twitter</a> (X app).</p><p class=align-left>He said men's mental health is usually neglected, and he understands how it feels, penning a motivation note for men on his timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKa6056prZmZo7qmutNomp6klZe%2FqsDInqpoaWdqg3J%2FjK2tZqCfqMFuwNNmpJugkWLCs7PErGSsmV2isq95wqGYq5%2BVYrKnss6rq2aZXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW63yJ2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
