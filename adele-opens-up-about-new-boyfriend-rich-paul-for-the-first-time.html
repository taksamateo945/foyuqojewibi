I always say that 21 doesn’t belong to me anymore. Everyone else took it into their hearts so much. I’m not letting go of this one. This is my album. I want to share myself with everyone, but I don’t think I’ll ever let this one go.”</p><p><strong>On not enjoying the dating process, and on meeting her new boyfriend, sports agent <a href=# title="Richard Paul"><strong>Richard Paul</strong></a>:</strong> “It’s been s–t. And 99.9 percent of the stories that have been written about me are absolutely made up. <strong>Rich</strong> just incredibly arrived. I don’t feel anxious or nervous or frazzled. It’s quite the opposite. It’s wild—and there is no second-guessing. I’m a 33-year-old divorced mother of a son, who’s actually in charge. The last thing I need is someone who doesn’t know where they’re at, or what they want. I know what I want. And I really know what I don’t want.”</p><p><strong>On the uproar around her weight loss:</strong> “My body’s been objectified my entire career. It’s not just now. I understand why it’s a shock. I understand why some women especially were hurt. Visually I represented a lot of women. But I’m still the same person. And the worst part of the whole thing was that the most brutal conversations were being had by other women about my body. I was very f–king disappointed with that. That hurt my feelings.”</p><p>Find out what else <a href=#>she said about her divorce, weight loss, and new music.</a></p><p>For more from<strong> Adele</strong>, head to <a href=#>Vogue.com</a>.</p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomZSauaZ5zqmcp6tdqr1urcGorK1lnprEbq7Osp2roZWjsW6%2ByJyfZqiRqrluss6rZK2glWKzqr7SrWStoZ2afA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
