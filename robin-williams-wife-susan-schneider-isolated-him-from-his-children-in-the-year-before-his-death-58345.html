She is a callous, cold woman,” the source continued.</p><p>“She wouldn’t even let the kids see him on his birthday,” the insider told <a href=#>Radar Online</a>. “[Robin] felt he married to someone whose motives went beyond love.”</p><p>In March, <a href=#>Susan went to court with Robin’s children</a> because of a dispute over the late comedian’s estate. Legal documents filed in December 2014 stated Susan asserted some of Robin’s personal items were wrongly taken from the California home they shared without her permission following his death.</p><p>The actor’s daughter, Zelda, vehemently denied these claims and assured she and her siblings did not take anything from the home, though they were legally entitled to their father’s “clothing, jewelry and personal photos” upon his passing. The court proceedings for this case are set to resume next month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9GomaKmXay2rbjImqSsZaees6Z50q6qmqZdqLCpusSim56qXZ7AsLjArZydZZieum6y0aikZqCZqHqktMilm6udnmK2r3nToZxmsZWWv26uxJ%2Bmq51dnba0ecOemK2gXWqFdICU</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
