All these meters have different codes for different purposes, such as credit balance check, credit amount, meter number, emergency credit, and consumption rate.</strong></p><p>These codes are usually inserted using the Customer Interface Unit or the User Interface Unit, which communicates to your meter. Here is everything to know about meter codes and how to use them correctly as error codes.</p><h2><strong>Mojec Meter Codes</strong></h2><p>There are numerous AEDC MOJEC meter codes that allow customers to carry out different assignments. These codes are used on the Customer Interface Unit (CIU) or User Interface Unit (UIU) which is sometimes regarded as the monitor in order to send commands to the meter.</p><p>Before this can be done, customers must have a meter and CIU and also activate it. This activation is done through the electricity distribution company website.</p><p>It is worth noting that MOJEC codes may vary depending on the region and the electricity distribution company you are using.</p><p>Below is the list of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) MOJEC meter codes and their uses. The states under the AEDC are Niger, Kogi, and Nasarawa States:</p><ul><li>009 (Credit Balance)</li><li>040 (Credit Amount)</li><li>070 (Current Date</li><li>100 (Meter Number)</li><li>048 (Emergency Credit)</li><li>200 (Previous Charged Date)</li><li>202 (Previous Charged Credit)</li><li>032 (Total Charging Amount)</li><li>045 (Disable Audio Alarm)</li><li>201 (Previous Charged Time)</li><li>203 (Previous Charged Token)</li></ul><h3><strong>List of Ikeja MOJEC Codes</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Ikeja Electricity (IE) </a>is found in the northern part of Lagos and some parts of Ogun State. The MOJEC meter codes to use in this distribution are:</p><ul><li>004 (Total Import Energy)</li><li>009 (Credit Balance)</li><li>040 (Credit Amount)</li><li>448 (Current Month Activate Total Energy)</li></ul><h3><strong>Jos Electricity Distribution Company (JED) MOJEC Codes</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>JED </a>is found in Plateau, Gombe, Bauchi, and Benue States, and MOJEC codes in this region are as follows:</p><ul><li>01 (Current Available Credit)</li><li>02 (Current Consumption Rate)</li><li>03 (Average Daily Consumption)</li><li>04 (Estimated Days Left)</li><li>05 (Last Billing Date)</li><li>06 (Last Billed Amount)</li><li>07 (Total Credit Recharged)</li><li>08 (Total Credit Used)</li><li>09 (Current Power)</li><li>10 (Meter Number)</li><li>11 (Supply Group Code)</li><li>12 (Tariff Index)</li></ul><h3><strong>Common MOJEC Error Codes, Their Meanings, and Solutions</strong></h3><p>Apart from meter codes, MOJEC also has error codes. As the name implies, error codes in your MOJEC prepaid meter indicate a problem faced by the meter, CIU, or both.</p><h4><strong>Error 1</strong></h4><p>When this error code is displayed on your CIU, it means that there is a Random Access Memory (RAM) issue. Most times, many individuals may not be able to fix this error on their own and may have to call the company for assistance.</p><h4><strong>Error 2</strong></h4><p>This is an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory Error, which is widely known as EEPROM. It is a technical error that causes your CUI memory to be erased or reprogrammed. You will need to contact the service provider to help you fix this technical error.</p><h4><strong>Error 3</strong></h4><p>Whenever error 3 appears on your CIU, it means that the power supply diode has failed. In another sense, the electrical component that allows the flow of current in only one direction is faulty. One common reason for this is excessive forward current and a large reverse voltage. In any case, you can contact a technician to have this error fixed.</p><h4><strong>Error 6</strong></h4><p>This connotes that you may be using the wrong key or that the key associated with the meter is faulty. Contact MOJEC customer care for help.</p><h4><strong>Error 10</strong></h4><p>This means that there is an error with the meter number. Ensure that you clean the keys and try again. Ensure that the CIU matches with the meter or contact the service provider if there is still an error for further assistance.</p><h4><strong>Error 12</strong></h4><p>This is a key pass error. For this error to appear, it means that you made an invalid key input. Check and try again or call for assistance.</p><h2><strong>Longi Prepaid Meter Codes</strong></h2><ul><li>800 (Total active forward energy)</li><li>801 (Credit balance)</li><li>802 (Date)</li><li>803 (Time)</li><li>804 (Meter serial number)</li><li>805 (SGC number)</li><li>806 (Contactor operation reason)</li><li>807 (Meter status)</li><li>808 (Total instantaneous power)</li><li>809 (Tariff index)</li><li>810 (Overdraft limit)</li><li>811 (Emergency credit)</li><li>812 (Cancel audible alarm)</li><li>813 (Total active energy of yesterday)</li><li>814 (Total active energy of the current month)</li><li>815 (Last recharge date)</li><li>816 (Last recharge time)</li><li>817 (Last recharge amount)</li><li>818 (Return logoff TOKEN)</li><li>819 (times of Power off)</li><li>820 (Active energy of last 1 month)</li><li>821 (Active energy of last 2 months)</li><li>822 (Active energy of last 3 months)</li><li>823 (Energy of last 4 months)</li><li>824 (Energy of last 5 months)</li><li>825 (Total energy of last 6 months)</li><li>830 (Tokenof last 1 recharge)</li><li>831 (Token code of last 2 recharge)</li><li>832 (Token of last 3 recharge)</li><li>834 (Token of last 5 recharge)</li><li>833 (Token code of last 4 recharge)</li><li>835 (Token code of last 6 recharge)</li><li>836 (Token number of last 7 recharge)</li><li>837 (Token code of last 8 recharge)</li><li>838 (Token of last 9 recharge)</li><li>839 (Token code of last 10 recharge)</li><li>865 (meter is in normal mode)</li></ul><h2><strong>IBEDC Prepaid Meter Codes</strong></h2><p>The IBEDC prepaid meter code is a 20-digit meter code that allows users to recharge prepaid meters.
