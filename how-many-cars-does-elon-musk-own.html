His oldest car is a Ford Model T from 1920, gifted to him by a friend. He has also owned a Jaguar E-Type, a Lotus Esprit used in a James Bond movie, and several newer supercars.

One is a Model T that a friend gave me and the other is a Series 1 '67 E-type Roadster. My first love.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 12, 2017</a></figure><p>For more on Elon Musk’s remarkable car collection, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>First Car</h2><p>Before becoming one of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk’s car collection had humble beginnings. In 1994, he <a href=# rel=noopener>bought a second-hand BMW 320i for $1,400</a>, the first version of the iconic BMW 3 Series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 10, 2019</a></figure><p>Even back then, Musk was pushing technology beyond what was expected. In this case, it was by replacing the 4-speed transmission with a 5-speed that he found in a Philadelphia junkyard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 10, 2019</a></figure><p>Musk’s 320i was from the late 1970s and was already in less than stellar condition when he bought it. A few years later, he <a href=# rel=noopener>allowed an intern at Zip2 to use the car for some errands</a> and a wheel fell off, spelling the end for his first BMW.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Classic Cars</h2><p>One of Musk’s classic cars is more than a half-century older. <a href=# rel=noopener>His Ford Model T dates back to 1920</a>, 12 years after the first models rolled off the production line.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Model T was the first mass-produced car in history</a> and changed the way automobiles were manufactured and distributed. It must have seemed an appropriate gift when a friend of Musk gave him the Ford, with the innovations of the past inspiring possibilities for the future.</p><p>Musk owns another legendary car, a Jaguar E-Type Roadster from 1967, <a href=# rel=noopener>widely considered one of the most beautiful and iconic cars ever made</a>. Musk was given a book of classic convertibles in 1988 when he was 17 years old, and the E-Type quickly became his favorite.</p><p>He decided that, if he could ever afford it, he would buy one. In 1995, after making $40,000 at Zip2, Musk spent the majority of the money on buying an E-Type. His ownership didn’t start perfectly, <a href=# rel=noopener>as the car broke down on his drive home</a>, but he had it fixed and it remained one of his prized possessions.</p><p>Musk made a less practical purchase in 2013 when he <a href=# rel=noopener>purchased a modified Lotus Esprit used in the filming of the James Bond movie</a> “The Spy Who Loved Me”. The Esprit had been modified into a functional submarine and abandoned before a Long Island couple bought it for $100 in a blind storage container sale.</p><p>Their investment paid off, as Musk bought the vehicle for just under a million dollars at an auction. Although it doesn’t transform as depicted in the film, Musk has said he wants to make that a reality.</p><p><a class=rank-math-link href=# rel=noopener>The Esprit’s design also served as an influence on his futuristic Tesla Cybertruck</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Supercars</h2><p>Musk’s other cars are too numerous to describe in detail. <a href=# rel=noopener>He owned a 1997 McLaren F1, a three-seater hypercar that was capable of reaching a maximum speed of 240mph</a>.</p><p>While driving with a friend, Musk put the car through its paces and ended up doing significant damage to the F1 (though thankfully not himself or his passenger). <a href=# rel=noopener>While selling PayPal to eBay in 2002, Musk made $165 million dollars</a> and used some of this money to repair the F1.</p><p>Musk sold the car in 2007, not wanting to face constant criticism for owning a high-performance gasoline sports car. Among his other cars have been a Hammam BMW M5, a Porsche 911 Turbo, an Audi Q7, and many of his own revolutionary Tesla vehicles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdlru6ecKaqaxllKSytHnEpaanZZ2qwKx5zrClaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
