When he forgot his She’s Kinda Hot solo…</h3><p lang=fr dir=ltr>Ashton forgot his solo on SKH ? || <a href=#>#SLFLBrighton</a> || Apr09 || via:@loveyourselfafi <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XusGNt8kbX</a></p><p>— 5sos Daily (@5SOS_Daily) <a href=#>April 9, 2016</a></p><p>We’ve all been there Ashton!</p><h3>21. When he sang Pizza at The Forum</h3><p></p><h3>20. Revealing his inner party side on nights out with Don Broco</h3><p>https://twitter.com/DONBROCO/status/723154763479670784</p><p>Drummers definitely have more fun!</p><h3>19. Calling Irish fans sardines, leaving everyone beyond confused</h3><p></p><p>Wanna explain Ashton?</p><h3>18. Bringing his little brother on stage at Sydney ROWYSO</h3><p></p><h3>17. When he got a haircut during ROWYSO and everyone lost it…</h3><p>https://twitter.com/5SOSTL__/status/643132756986171392</p><p>We’re just SO glad it’s grown a teenie bit for the SLFL tour, sorry Ashton but you really rocked the long hair look.</p><h3>16. The ‘Here We Fucking Go’ ballad in Glasgow</h3><p></p><p>This should not work as well as this does. Musical genius? We think so!</p><h3>15. His heartfelt apology for the drumstick incident</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Apparently a girl got hit by a drum stick tonight… I can not express how incredibly sorry I am… I am so sorry :(</p><p>— Ashton Irwin (@Ashton5SOS) <a href=#>August 1, 2015</a></p><p>Anyone else read this in Ashton’s voice? Maybe work on your aim next year….</p><h3>14. His ‘Hey’ drum button</h3><p>https://vine.co/v/eqOTmK6lzap</p><p>We also found out peer pressure from Luke and Michael makes Ashton cave in. Even during Calum’s solo in Amnesia, we shouldn’t have laughed but we did! (Sorry Calum!)</p><h3>13. His attempt at teaching Calum the cup song</h3><p>https://twitter.com/safehousemgc/status/744481729449164804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</p><p>Now that’s a talent we’re envious of. Fancy teaching us Ashton?</p><h3>12. When Ashton let a fan play his drums and got outdone…</h3><p></p><p>When Ashton let Lewis play on his kit in Oberhausen it’s safe to say the fanbase lost their minds. Ashton also appeared to lose his too upon realising just how great this stranger from the crowd was… You’ll always be our number one, promise!</p><h3>11. Ashton vs praying mantis</h3><p></p><p>But who won? We’ll let you have this one Ashton just because it’s almost your birthday.</p><h3>10. The End Up Here solo</h3><p></p><h3>9. When he got a brand new SLFL drumkit</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Holy shit, you'll be seeing this beast on sounds live feels live this year xx <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/47wbTUcH1e</a></p><p>— Ashton Irwin (@Ashton5SOS) <a href=#>January 18, 2016</a></p><p>Suddenly we found ourselves getting very very excited over sparkly drum kits.</p><h3>8. His Rejects speech</h3><p></p><p>Thanks for reminding us that it’s okay to be a reject Ashton, we all need to do this sometimes. But for now let’s wipe away the tears which have formed quickly.</p><h3>7. His SLFL tour speech</h3><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6edgR6FCxI</p><p>Ashton might not do a lot of talking at shows but when he does it’s worth the wait. The heartfelt speeches thanking fans and also the guys never fail to make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</p><h3>6. The backstage dancing which made us a little jealous</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is so funny ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gwIWXYnhQU</a></p><p>— sarah ? (@ashpoppin) <a href=#>April 21, 2016</a></p><p>From cup song to dancing is there anything this man can’t do?</p><h3><span>5. The musical gem ‘I want a hotdog’</span></h3><p></p><p>Imagine being the girl this was written about, you got a hotdog AND a song written about you. Not a bad night for that lucky girl!</p><h3><span><span><strong>4. Mashton moments&nbsp;</strong></span></span></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>When Ashton was having an emotional hometown moment and Michael ruined it ? – H <a href=#>#HerestoROWYSOMemories</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6FUTJFt42g</a></p><p>— 5SOS UPDATES ? (@5sosworldalerts) <a href=#>September 12, 2015</a></p><p>There was plenty of these throughout the tours, but this might have been one of our favourites!</p><h3><span>3. The final bows&nbsp;</span></h3><p></p><p>We loved when they provided additional Lashton moments like this one… You can tell how happy Ashton is when onstage with his friends playing to an adoring crowd.</p><h3>2. Being able to watch his confidence grow from tour to tour</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>We are just getting started out here, thank you for making our lives amazing, I love playing to you every night ??xx <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JVLn8JPefp</a></p><p>— Ashton Irwin (@Ashton5SOS) <a href=#>April 12, 2016</a></p><p>We love watching you play and grow in confidence, Ashton. Thank you for making our lives amazing too!</p><h3>1. When he tweeted this, made the whole fanbase melt and reminded us why we love him so much!</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>I tweeted this a few years ago! And tomorrow night we would have finished our first ever world arena tour.I love you! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Wu8vQui8yn</a></p><p>— Ashton Irwin (@Ashton5SOS) <a href=#>September 12, 2015</a></p><p>From all of us at CelebMix, we’d like to wish Ashton the best 22nd birthday possible.
